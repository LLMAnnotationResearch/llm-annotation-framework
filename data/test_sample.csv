To order in bulk, we must order a minimum of 50lbs of tea for each blend we create. Considering that each teaspoon of tea weighs less than one tenth of an ounce äóñ that's a lot of tea!

" ë_ Conjure Trading Card game is a brand new trading card experience targeted at existing gamers in the TCG industry. Featuring a revolutionary 5 tier unrestricted evolution system, the game play is fast paced while still maintaining its strong strategic element. It is Very easy for gamers to pick up and play featuring Dragons, Knights, Warriors, Beasts, Light/Dark Magic, Vehicles, Mounted units and more! If you enjoy TCG or are frustrated at the $$$ required to compete in other TCG's or even the lack of customization in some games where you can only pick 1 class then Conjure is for you! Customise your Strategy using Spirit, Spell, Counter cards and more. Featuring AMAZING artwork and a higher quality of cards and boards than any other TCG. Conjure Starter Decks are not only competitive but the rules allow for multiple types to be include in your deck greatly increasing your options and adding layers to your strategy.   The Conjure TCG fan base has EXPLODED since demoing in Melbourne Australia and is receiving a lot of attention from international stores and distributors - Our fans have now taken it on themselves to start running their own events to help grow the community. We have demos being played all over the world! The board also plays an intricate part in Conjure as even if you have the winning cards, if you position your spirits wrong then you will have a hard time winning ""I messed up my positioning and got wiped out, it wasnt untill the next game when I used both cards and positioning to the fullest that i was able to beat him"" quote by a first time player at our last demo.  ë_ Most importantly our rewards tiers work out to be around 50% cheaper then buying it when it comes out so Jump on board Now! Teaser Trailer Before I go into the spiel of why this is a great project to invest in and our current success, let me take a quick moment to explain why Conjure TCG is quite different to other Kickstarter projects. Kickstarter is a fantastic initiative that helps creative ideas get off the ground and _ÑÒKick start_Ñù their success. Conjure TCG has been in development for over 3 years so is past its initial stage. We are so confident with Conjure that we have already taken it to the market and had fantastic results in terms of market acceptance. We have printed samples of many completed cards and have taken the game to 8 of the top trading card game stores in Australia and all 8 are prepared to stock the Conjure already. We are already getting attention overseas particularly in the UK and America so we will be able to supply Conjure Internationally. This shows that Conjure is already near its final development making your pledge an investment to the future of our endeavour. Not to mention it is fantastic value for money when compared to purchasing the product after its release from the Stores. As mentioned above we have also run a couple of demos for the public and not only did we have a fantastic turn out but the fans (The Conjurers) were very excited. Some were so excited they (Completely independently) filmed their experience as well as an instructional video and posted it on YouTube. Starter Decks have been revealed The Conjurers (Fans) - Game play Video ë_Ok, so now to back track to the idea itself. Conjure TCG is a game based around Conjuring spirits to the field to move across a board to battle your opponent reducing their health points to 0. There are 2 other ways to win but we won_Ñét go into that now. The cards and artwork look fantastic but at the end of the day what makes the game successful is the gameplay. We have some images on our website   to give you a teaser for the quality of artwork. I am VERY confident that the quality of the images will impress. I have also attached some images on this listing. Conjure has 3 different rule books, the most basic version is very easy to pick up and play with a learning curve of around 5 mins. Below I will go into why this TCG is completely different from its predecessors:  _Ñ¢5 tier unrestricted evolution system_Ñ_ the 5 x tiers are titled Infant, Apprentice, Master, Titan & Legendary. When we say unrestricted we mean that unlike PokÕ©mon any Infant Knight can turn into any Apprentice Knight rather then you have to get a specific card to link to the next. This helps the gameplay flow rather than waiting for a single card that could be at the bottom of the deck resulting in a 1 sided (luck based) game  _Ñ¢There are 11 different types of Spirits: Dragon, Knight, Warrior, Mounted, Beast, Dark, Demon, Light, Angel, Vehicle and the 11th type will not be in either the 1st, 2nd or 3rd release. This is something that we are keeping up our sleeve. We are also happy for our backers to contribute suggestions to this.  _Ñ¢Game play is on a board with a grid where movement and positioning play a part in the flow of battle _Ñ_ this element is very new to this industry and will attract board game players as well but is not too significant where it scares off traditional TCG players. The big surprise is how fast the game play is despite being on a board which traditionally are slow paced games. _Ñ¢A fantastic range of artwork and quality of the printed cards match if not succeed the current industry standard  _Ñ¢Spell, Counter and Corrupted stone cards greatly affect the flow of battle meaning that it_Ñés not just about who can Conjure the strongest Spirit  _Ñ¢A fantasy short story has been written to explain why we play Conjure and its importance _Ñ_ _ÑÒWe battle for peace, We Conjure to survive_Ñù slogan. This can be viewed on our website,   - click on ""Lore"". We are looking to further develop this to provide a full RPG experience _Ñ¢Exciting gameplay that is both action packed without being too fast that it loses its strategic element  _Ñ¢The game has 3 different rule books _Ñ_ Infant, Apprentice and Master. Infant level is much more basic where there are no carryover points and is much more simple to play where Master is more involved and has more variables. The idea behind this was that we don_Ñét exclude the younger (Pokemon/Ben 10/Skylanders) fans while the complexity of the Master rules will greatly appeal to Magic and War Hammer fans. This also means that anyone can pick up the game and play it with a very short learning curve. ë_Why we are launching now? Over the last 2-4 years the world of TCG has experienced its biggest ever growth. What has also happened in the industry is that one of the biggest games has recently (without much notice) stopped printing Trading Cards leaving a nice gap in the industry and on store shelves. There are 2 reasons why Melbourne has been picked as the ideal city firstly over 40% of the gaming community of Australia is located in Melbourne. Secondly (and as a consequence to that) PAX is a MAJOR event that was incredibly successful last year and will double in size when it is run in October 2014. We want to have a large representation at this event as it was profoundly successful for other TCG_Ñés and the stores that were there. They are expecting over 50,000 people at the upcoming event, it is so big that they are hiring the entire Exhibition center in the city (Melbourne). But please know that Conjure is a National product from launch with the facility to supply internationally. Our business plan is that we will launch in the stores in April with our first release (250 cards), 2 months later will be the second release (150 cards) and just before PAX a 3rd release (150 cards) completing the Conjure Origins series which consists of 550 cards. The second release will be the Dragon/Vehicle release, because there is such focus on Dragons in these types of games we will save them for the second and we will promote _ÑÒThe Dragons are coming_Ñù. If you read the story there is also a reason based on the story of Conjure as to why both the Dragons and Vehicles are not part of the first release. All players are referred to as Conjurers, they register with us and they receive a custom printed card with their name and favorite image for free. If they win tournaments they can have their card updated with their stats. We will also have a ranking system to increase competitiveness. 1 - We will be featuring on the popular TV show New Game Plus to advertise the launch as well as the first tournament 2 - The First tournament will be the Registered player number 1 tournament. As mentioned before all players are  registered and receive a registration number that is theirs forever. The winner of the first tournament will be crowned player number 1! They will be player number 1 forever. This will encourage gamers to jump on board Conjure at the start rather then wait for it to become successful. This was a very big hit at the demos. So the major products that will be involved with the release is:  _Ñ¢Trading cards _Ñ_ they come in Starter Deck and Booster Pack _Ñ¢A Premium option for the board    _Ñ¢Terrain Tiles Additional options that will be released as the product begins to generate momentum:  _Ñ¢Small figures that represent the different types eg: Demon has a small skull    _Ñ¢Large statues with the Conjure logo on it eg: 18cm Dragon statue that lights up and changes colour _Ñ_ comes in a set of 4 _Ñ_looks fantastic _Ñ_ there are a range of these product. My team and I have all thoroughly enjoyed the experience so far and can_Ñét wait to take the product to market. I have had fairly extensive experience running businesses for different business owners and am very comfortable with the business aspect of the project. However, I can provide specifics of my business experience if you like, to put it quickly I was an Area manager at 19 years old and a general manager at 28 years old What the finance will be used for:    _Ñ¢Further play testingë_ _Ñ¢Further art development _Ñ_ around 50 cards left to design _Ñ_ 500 completed    _Ñ¢Booking an area and paying for advertising for PAX - the minimum will book a small area but I would ideally like to look at a larger presence  _Ñ¢Printing stock _Ñ_ cards and boards    _Ñ¢Invest more time into the website _Ñ_ it is a little bare at the moment    _Ñ¢Target interstate stores  I have already paid for the design of the previous 500 cards, as well as producing the 15 different card designs and layouts. The rule books are currently being design but that will be at my cost. We have also paid for the website to be developed and for the Short Story to be professionally reviewed and edited. Several different samples of cards have also been produced _Ñ_thousands in order to get the absolute best quality. All of these items have been paid for and no funds from Kickstarter would be allocated to replace these. ë_I hope this has been helpful and reassuring that you are contributing and becoming a part of an incredibly exciting product. If we are able to over shoot the budget, these funds will be put into the further development of the product and potentially develop the concept of an RPG experience through a different media. VERY EXCITING but back to reality, lets make Conjure Trading Card Game and the sky is the limit!!!  I really hope I have provided enough information for you to make an educated decision, this is our first time using Kickstarter and we are a little conscious of babbling on for too long however, if you have any questions at all please email me and I will responds within 24 hours. I am also happy to provide my mobile should you like to discuss it or you can message me via email or face book - Conjure Trading Card Game. Some backers have requested me to put Add ons to their existing rewards which I am more than happy to do.

"Bull Crap is a quick game of deception. Can you fool your friends? Or will they sense your Bull Crap? Find out with this hilarious game of wits!  The game deck will be split evenly between each player. The order of play will be chosen at random. Each player will then take a turn laying cards face down in the discard pile. When you place cards you want to get rid of as many cards as possible! For example; if you have 3 Bull cards and 1 chicken, then you will want to try and get rid of that chicken with the bulls. You will lay all four cards down and say ""four Bulls"". If nobody suspects you're lying then the game will proceed, however, if someone says ""Bull Crap"" one of two things will happen. 1: If you lied then you will have to take all the cards from the discard pile. 2: If you told the truth, then they have to take all the cards from the discard pile!  It's simple, easy to learn, and fun!  There are two ways to play! 1: Quick play. In this version of play the first person to discard all their cards is declared the winner and the game resets. This is the simple way to play. 2: Elimination. In this version the game continues until only one person has cards in their hand. That person is out for the next round and the new round begins without that person. This continues until there is only one person standing!  My name is Tyler King! I am the creator behind the game and have been working on it for the past few months. I have already had a successful Kickstarter go from start to finish! When it comes to Kickstarter I already know my way around a bit! I have backed over 200 projects that had very little publicity because I believe in helping the little guy get funded! This won't show up on this profile because my current one is having problems at the moment, but if you want a link I'll be happy to send it to you! I am driven to get every single one of my projects funded and shipped to all you awesome people! I work day and night to answer questions and work on issues regarding the Kickstarter! I promise if you back this project you will be taken care of from the moment you back up until you get your game! ë_ The box will contain 60 cards. With each reward tier you advance in the price will get progressively cheaper. For example the standard deck will be $20 the double deck will be $38 (A $2 decrease).  The box will look like this: The Standard card will look like this: Each deck will contain 2 Bomb cards. These bomb cards will twist up the game! They are used as wild cards. So if you have two chickens and a bomb you can say you have 3 chickens. If someone says Bull crap when you use a bomb cards, then they have to draw the discard deck! The bomb cards will look like this: ë_ ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_  US-$5ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_Canada-$10ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_EU-$20ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_Australia-$25 ë_ We will still ship to you if you live outside one of these countries, however because of the price of shipping we will have to use our highest price. So anywhere not listed will be $25. If you have any questions about shipping please feel free to contact me here on Kickstarter.  Thanks to all those who back this project!

"The skeletons in tutus are a reaction to the media's ridiculous expectations that can never be met. The story of a prima ballerina that ""ate one too many sugar plums"" hit home. These drawings are asking the media if my ballerina is in fact thin enough.ë_I, like the ballerina, have struggled with eating disorders in the past. I am hoping to bring awareness to our society and stand up to the media that holds us accountable to this perfectionism. We are beautiful for who we are in our ""own skin"". ë_ My hope is that art can help impact the mindset of society from thin to healthy and help others overcome their struggles with eating disorders. How can I/you make a difference? Your pledge is a message to the media that we have had it with all the false ads and criticisms that we are exposed to on a daily basis. By supporting this program, it will allow me to help fund other programs that that are near and dear to my heart like bullying and breast cancer. One artist can make a difference if others have a say in it! My goal is to have all items produced and at your door prior to the holidays.ë_""",0,10.1266311,0,Illustration,2012
"Writerase is a family, or forest as we like to call them, of dry erase notebooks. ë_Each of our 'Leaf' notebooks come with 50 pages of writable surface, orë_25 sheets, of pure white paper coated in a thin yet resilient coating allowing you to use most dry erase pens. ë_Furthermore each Leaf comes with 2 sheets of transparencies, allowing you to quickly mark up your most important thoughts or drawings. Have you ever used a whiteboard to generate ideas, solve complex math problems, as an artistic medium or as a study tool? What if you were able to bring this experience wherever you went?ë_ Well we have taken the best traits from whiteboards and portable notebooks to develop our line of Writerase notebooks. From now on, you_Ñéll have the ability to put the whiteboard in your backpack wherever life takes you! Writerase notebooks are meant for anyone; whether you are a student, professional, artist or kid, you will love using our notebooks. Your brain is full of ideas but let's be honest some of them probably need iteration. With our easily erasable medium Writerase, you can rapidly build on even your wildest ideas. ë_With non-permanent overhead markers your well thought out ideas or your moments of clarity will stay perfectly intact for as long as you like; or at least until you run out of space and decide your Robotic-Army-Invasion-Plan needs revision. Use your Writerase as a platform to give yourself a pretend lecture by breaking down difficult topics into more manageable pieces, outlining key learning points, and approaching topics from different views. After you are done reading and memorizing information, see how much you can recall by writing it down and sharing your notes with your classmates. Writerase gives you the freedom to make mistakes and allows others to collaborate.ë_ Take it from me, mistakes are bound to happen. One major part of learning when solving problems is correcting the mistakes in your work. With Writerase, your work is easily correctable. Unlike a pencil, you can erase a whole page in a matter of seconds without leaving any marks and without wasting any paper. ë_Another perk to Writerase is that you can use a multitude of different colors. Plus, it looks so much better than pencil or pen. Use your Writerase to take a break, have some fun. Whether you're a kid or an adult, you can find some fun in good old-fashioned pen and dry-erase paper games. There are a variety of games such as Tic-tac-toe, Hangman, Dot and Boxes, or M.A.S.H., etc., that you can play with our dry erase notebooks. Writerase is a great way to play old fashioned games with your kids or entertain your colleagues at lunch break. Or in my case,  Draw, doodle and sketch in full color on a reusable medium. Save your ideas or erase them with a single wipe. Writerase is the ideal medium for the creative side in all of us. There are many techniques for creating dry erase surfaces.  Some are cheap and some aren't.  We've been experimenting with many different coating techniques using papers sourced from around the world.  We've taken what we've learned and implemented them into our forest of products.  Each of our Leaf notebooks feature an incredibly smooth surface which creates a comfortable and enjoyable writing experience.  This incredibly smooth surface was the most crucial part of our work. Most lamination and spray techniques give you very similar results on photos or videos. However, the surface smoothness is what creates the comfort and enjoyment of writing. You will have to try it yourself to see how comfortable it is to write on. This experience can not be captured in a video. We made sure to create a precisely smooth surface so you will never get tired of writing on these papers. Using a custom manufacturing process, buyers will be able to choose from either blank, lined, or grid paper as well as customize their cover page with their own unique design. Send us any photo, logo, or text and we will make that the cover of your notebook. ë_This option will only be offered for free to our valued Kickstarter backers. Our design goal when creating the Writerase prototype was to create a durable, long-life, reusable notebook and as a result, we chose the highest quality paper we could source. ë_We did lots of impromptu paper strength test comparison which can be found in our extra youtube videos. If you are anything like me, you spill coffee. ë_A lot.ë_ Luckily, we've got you covered.ë_ All of our Leaf notebooks are water resistant.ë_ You can simply wipe the Leaf notebooks with a cloth to clean and dry the sheets.ë_ Keep in mind that the papers are water resistant meaning that if you drop water on them, they won't get destroyed. However, most dry erase pens are water soluble,  so your work will be wiped out if you drop water on it.   (Applying water is actually one fast way of cleaning the whole page).  If you want to have a more permanent piece of writing or drawing but you want to keep working on it, you can use the extra transparent papers. We've added two transparent papers, one on the first page and one on the last page. This way, you can draw a calendar or to do list, and then keep marking it up without damaging the original. Unlike our competitors, we use high quality double loop metal bindings. Double-loop (Wire-O) uses formed wire that threads through rectangular holes which allows books to lay flat when open. This type of binding gives a more solid and professional look to your notebook as compared to any other type of coil or comb binding.ë_ Currently, we offer the Writerase in 4 different sizes. Since one of our main goals was to promote an environmentally friendly writing option, the size names were inspired from tree leaves and their sizes:  ë_ To give you a variety of choices, we have 10 reward options. Each Writerase notebook has 54 pages (25 white sheets 2 transparent sheets). Keep in mind that you can also customize your notebook (page type and the cover page) absolutely for free. The following prices include shipping to the United States and Canada and an extra for other international destinations.ë_ 1-ë_Your own arboretum! Mix-and-match whichever Leaf's you want.

Based on the final agreement with our print shop, the first batch must be a minimum of 10_Ñé000 pages of 8_Ñùx11_Ñù sheets, 6'500 square feet, or since we're Canadian, about 600 square meters. The cut sizes of individual sheets can vary as long as the total minimum area is achieved.   Based off of the number of Kickstarter orders, we will start the whole procedure by printing the double sided pages (lined, grids, or blank).   This will be done using state of the art (pun-intended) printing equipment.  This step should take one to three days from the date the batch order is placed.  ë_ The next step is the most crucial step.  This step is where the pages get coated in ultraviolet sensitive dry-erase gloss.  The printed sheets will be coated in the print shop and then carefully cured using high intensity ultraviolet lights.  Our experience has shown that the curing process is the most critical step in the production process.  Our work has shown that small deviations from the ideal process can create ridges in the papers surface or leave the papers tacky.  To assure that we do not have any sheets which are below our exacting standards we have determined that this step will take ten to fifteen days.  This estimate will change depending on the volume of orders placed.  ë_ After this stage, the sheets are cut to final size.  This is a rather fast step in the production cycle as it is fully automated.  For this step we have allotted one to two days.  To allow complete customization and to increase the quality of the final product, we have decided to manually bind each notebook.  Custom covers will be printed on 15 point high quality sheets.  They will then be attached to your desired page type using our table binding machine.  We chose the highest quality metal binding which we could source, the double-loop metal binding.  This type of binding is very strong, it is also the most comfortable binding option for medium sized notebooks.  Each of the team members will be participating in this step as it will be the most laborious.ë_ ë_We have allotted two to six days depending on the volume of notebooks ordered.  If over 2000 notebooks are ordered, an extra binding setup will be used in order to keep the working time under 6 days.   Adding up all these numbers, the manufacturing time is expected to take anywhere from 12 to 25 days.  This timeline will be adjusted based on the volume of orders and will also updated to reflect any obstacles or any time saving steps we can conceive.  We predict that all orders will be en route to everyone by end of April to early May.  ë_ For our extra reward option, we have made 15 point 8""x11"" double sided white board sheet.  The manufacturing procedure for this is exactly the same as our sheets, except we used extra thick papers.  Finally, we send them to you.  Posting time will vary by location but we expect that ship time will be 2 to 6 days for the United States and Canada, shipping outside of these countries will take longer, approximately 4 to 8 days.""",0,8.779557456,1,Product Design,2014

Remember, we were born with only 2 hands, but life often decides to overwhelm you with stuff that would require at least 3 or more hands.  Life can be like running the gauntlet at these moments.ë_ We would have preferred to find a way to get you more hands,  but this was a bit challenging with our current technology,  so it led us to_Ñ_  In my situation, I_Ñém often using my mini tablet, but I don_Ñét want to carry a bag for it, so I generally look for jackets with pockets big enough to fit my tablet, in order to keep it within reach.  However sometimes I wanted direct access or I didn_Ñét want to wear a jacket. So I did what I always do.  I used my tablet to search the internet to see if a solution for that already existed. Guess what?  There were some for smart phones, but I could find only one for mini tablets.   Check it out yourself.  .  This was not what I was looking for.  I wanted a real carrier.  So after searching the internet I decided to solve it myself, and 2-3 weeks later I had my first prototype.   Yes that is what its looked like, but it got the job done, ë_ at least to a certain point.   I was able to carry my tablet it was fixed on the board but I couldn_Ñét get it to remain stable and in the desired position on the arm.  I could have it quite loose, so it was comfortable to wear, but then the board would turn upside down after some use.   If I put it on too tight, it became very uncomfortable and still tended to move after a period of time.   So I had to quite literally go back to the drawing board.  After another 2-3 weeks I came up with a solution. It was the hand which would provide control and stability. So this was how it looks after its first upgrade.  ë_However it seemed to work, but my choice of materials was not as durable as I wanted it to be.  While my   was more like a side project towards other entrepreneurial developments I had during this time, I left it like this, although I always intended to look for ways to improve it. As time passed by, I saw my opportunity during an exhibition I was attending. I met up with a company that was working in the therapeutic joint bandage industry, which was similar to what I had in mind for the   part of my  . So after some late night Skype sessions, they were willing to provide me with the Prototype I had in mind  and this I how the first true   was born.  But during my work with the Prototype, I realized that it could be more than just a tablet holder. I recently had one of these _ÑÒ _Ñù moments again and I asked myself the question that is responsible for starting more revolutions and that leads to more innovations than any other question.    So I took a closer look at the stuff that is thrown at us and I realized that we don_Ñét need 3 hands all the time. Mostly you just need to store stuff for a second without putting it too far away.  Remember so near, but yet so far away. Or you need access to information or tools from time to time. This was the point where I decided to give the   its smartness.   gives you the freedom to store stuff for a moment or longer but still keep it close at hand.

"Northern Guard: Assault isë_the new evolution of Tower Defense games.ë_ By combining the Tower Defense genre with Real Time Strategy games and Role Playing games, we have developed a unique hybrid mobile experience. The game focusesë_on a set of upgradeableë_mobile units (the heroes), as opposed to purchasing and placing stationery turrets.ë_You are able to deploy and maneuver the heroesë_on a map where you must achieve a variety of objectives, allë_while fending off waves of enemy units and super powered villains. NG:A will be released on both the iOS and Android platforms inë_ . The story of Northern Guard: Assault starts with you assuming command of Canada_Ñés first Government sponsored and military backed super-hero team, Northern Guard. Almost at that exact moment, a full frontal assault is launched on Parliament Hill. An unknown foe attempts to eliminate not only the Prime Minister of Canada, but also a good chunk of its leadership. Your team is called in to defend Canada_Ñés leaders and ascertain the identity of ë_the villain behind the attack. This results in the team criss-crossing the Canadian landscape as they learn the threat is much greater than they ever imagined, not just to Canada but to the entire world. The story and overall motif is a combination of The Avengers with Stargate SG-1, asë_Northern Guard is a joint military and civilian operation that tackles situations involving other super-powered enemies that potentially threaten the security of the world if left unchecked. Unlike many TD games, NG:A will have a fully articulated narrative that gives the player freedom to control how the story plays out, with a range of consequences based on those decisions. For example, at one point in the game the player is given the choice between protecting a major communication hub or following a lead that points to a remote airfield. If the player chooses to protect the communication hub, the enemy is able to fortify its position in later levels; whereas if the player chooses to investigate the airfield, the communication hub is destroyed directly affecting their ability to determine enemy positions. Many of the heroes that populate the NG:A landscape originate from my teenage mind and have stuck with me throughout the years, slowly being refined into their current iterations. Each character has unique powers that impact gameplay in different fashions. ë_The short answer is we need funding.  This is a passion project, but everyone knows that money makes the world go _ÑÉround and we need funding to execute this project to its fullest potential.  The time is NOW; independent developers are thriving and gaming is extremely accessible via mobile devices. There is HUGE potential to develop something that is not only distinctively Canadian but also meaningful, fun, and appealing to a wider audience.  And the only way we will achieve this is with funding; funding we will get on Kickstarter, with support from people like you. ë_ Please be our hero and support Northern Guard: Assault and invest in the Canadian Indie Game Dev Industry. Northern Guard: Assault is a gaming idea that has been swirling around for a few years; in my head, on paper, and in a few ill-fated attempts at creating it during my free time. Most of the characters you will encounter in-game were created while I was in my early teens in rural Manitoba. And while I have made some advances on the project over the years, it has never progressed at a pace that I liked. So recently, after my contract was unexpectedly cut short at what I would call one of the best game studios ever, I decided thatë_ ë_was the time to focus solely on this project and bring it to the light of day. Ultimately, the goal is not to rake in money; it's to create a game that not only kicks ass, but is engaging and meaningful. Something real gamers can appreciate; a deep but accessible piece of gaming. NG:A is an ambitious project for an independent developer. The objective is to produce a game that meets the expectations of _ÑÒgamers_Ñù while maintaining the accessibility to be successful in the mobile gaming market.ë_ Outside of outstanding gameplay, NG:A is a standalone gaming experience. No ads (BUY RANDOM PRODUCT X), no in-app purchases required (Continue playing for $5), no resource gating (you need coins to continue), no social gating (share with your friends to keep playing). Play when you want, for however long you want.ë_ Unity! NG:A will be powered by Unity, a game engine that will allow development on multiple platforms simultaneously, while providing a large contingent of resources and fellow developers in times of need. Aside from picking up a couple bits of hardware, covering the cost of the rewards and the platform licenses for Unity, the entirety of the budget will be used for production of the game, as a large portion of the design phaseë_is already completed.ë_The primary need is for a full-time artist. While I'm proud of what has been achieved,ë_the entire experience will be elevatedë_by having art that reflects the intensity and passion that is fueling the project. Secondly, another developer will be brought in as a consultant in order to optimize the numerous systems thatë_are required.ë_As this is a mobile project, the code has to be tight and two minds are better than one when it comes examining andë_refining code. Finally, a small chunk of funds will be reserved for audio production. The features detailed above encapsulate the vision that is Northern Guard: Assault. That being said, there are a few features I have shelved (for the sequel of course) that would really expand the ""superhero team manager"" experience, which was scaled back for NG:A. ë_Should funding surpass our goal, these additional features will be implemented to enhance that experience. With 5 years experience in the gaming industry, I may not yet qualify as an _ÑÒindustry vet_Ñù, but I have worked on several vastly different projects at EA Canada and BioWare Edmonton; including Mass Effect 3 and Dragon Age: Inquisition. Prior to getting into the industry I had my hand in several small scale projects (some of which you can check out at  ) while earning my BSc from the School of Interactive Art and Technology at Simon Fraser University, where I majored in ""Informatics"" (or, as the rest of the world calls it, Interactive Media Development).ë_ Nowadays, if not in front of a screen (either working on or playing games) I'm probably playing floor hockey, sketching in my notebook, or spending time with my soon-to-be 2 year old son, Alex. ë_Finally, I'll be Kicking it Forward! ë_The short version is that we will be using 5% of the finished product profits back into other Kickstarter projects. ë_I'll make an effort to keep it Canadian, but an awesome project is an awesome project.

"We are in the process of creating a small hydroponic produce business, that will aim to grow a variety of crops to be sold to local restaurants, caterers, and groceries. We are dedicated to the ideals of sustainability, quality, and locality. By growing hydroponically, we will be able to be %100 pesticide-free, while using only 1/20th the amount of water and 1/10th the amount of land used by traditional agriculture. Our sales model will be focused on customer-specific orders, and four season production. Because the growth cycles in a hydroponic system are just four to six weeks from seed to harvest, we will be able to meet with clients - before ever planting - to determine precisely what they would like to see on their menus, catering trays, or shelves. Then, in about a month's time, we will deliver those plants directly to the customer's door. Because we are limiting our sphere of sales to within a 40 mile radius of our greenhouse, we will be able to personally deliver fresh-picked produce on a weekly basis; and therefore provide a superior product, at a vastly reduced cost to the environment. This $5,000 will fully fund the fresh water well we will need to operate our business. It will also allow us to seasonally cultivate the remaining 2 acres in a sustainable organic manner and sell the produce at local farmers market.

"The Denver HAHO is a community of creative handmade entrepreneurs and conscientious shoppers here in Denver! ë_Holding markets has been so much fun, and highly beneficial for our local economy, but it's time to take things a few steps further. ë_By funding this Kickstarter, you can help us build a handmade business incubator with a work/event space for this community to use and enjoy! ë_Member-based programming, including discounts for goods and services, additional exposure, and other tools, combined with access to a crafty co-working and event space and even a commercial kitchen, will help local producers grow their businesses! ë_ The HAHO's commitment has been to offer a low-risk environment in which new and micro-businesses can test out the market, see what products work, and obtain feedback from other makers and the general public. ë_We've done this by charging a nominal feeë_for vendors to participate in the market, and making sacrifices in our operational budget. ë_ The HAHO's efforts, combined with community support,ë_have helped dozens of handmade business owners build their networks and products, and even become full-time operators. ë_Heard ofë_ ,ë_ ë_orë_ ? ë_They all started at the HAHO!

We can't forget that all of this doesn't happen without lots of dedication and hard work. ë_If you have ever developed something that you believed in with little or no pay, you know what I am talking about! ë_In order to make it possible for us to focus our efforts on making the HAHO Vendorship Program as successful and sustainable as possible, we've built a stipend into the budget. ë_Once membership is stable and the other programming is up and running, we should be good to go! ë_ ë_began 5 years ago asë_a venue for friends to barter their creativity, discoveries and skills with each other. ë_It was a form of economic activism, with people exchanging through barter, focusing on hyper-local consumption and production, and creating wealth with one another without the use of currency. ë_More and more people wanted to be involved, to share their skills and homemade goodies, or to shop for one-of-a-kind crafts made by people they knew or could talk to, and so it grew.ë_ As the HAHO grew, we incorporated anë_ ë_and a skill share database, and we hope to continue providing services that encourage the community to reevaluate their purchasing power and to make it easier to start a craft-based business.ë_ Now, let's see what our handmade community has provided as perks for the campaign! ë_We are so thankful for all of the generous donations that many of our crafty friends have donated to the cause. ë_ New perk!: ë_A big thanks to the creative community for taking the time and considering this project. ë_The greatest things happen when the people come together!

"ë_ ë_ ë_ ë_ ë_ ë_   Hello and welcome to our pitch for Kidz Time TV, an adult comedy set around the production of a live children's television show. The show is about the ins and outs of a band of mis«ÎÅts, the dysfunctional team behind former ratings behemoth Kidz Time TV. Kidz Time TV is an after school TV children's programme similar to Blue Peter, Live and Kicking, SMTV:Live and similar young people's shows of the 90's.ë_ At the beginning of the series  the show is suffering in the ratings and is in danger of folding but due to a number of unforeseen disasters we see it boosted in popularity and  it becomes a controversial smash hit show.ë_The show focuses on the crew, whose complicated lives off the set often spill on to live television and make Kids Time TV more entertaining but for all the wrong reasons.ë_ At the heart of Kids Time TV is a romance.  Laura the show_Ñés producer has been having an ill-advised and secret affair with her married boss Mike for the past two years. Mike, the ""Mr Wickham"" of the piece, strings Laura along with no intention of making a real commitment to her. Ben, the ""Mr Darcy"" of the piece and the show's new writer, is Laura's best friend from university who has been secretly in love with her for the past 8 years. Laura meanwhile is completely oblivious.ë_ Other characters include: Sophia the beautiful, new presenter who turns Laura's world upside down. Rich, the presenter and classically trained actor who treats all his lines as if he's performing Shakespeare. JJ the sound guy, the idiot of the show, and his geeky side kick Dennis the VT editor. Angus is the 90 year old puppeteer who worked in the broom cupboard in the 80's, and Nigel is the cameraman who thinks everyone who works on the show are morons. He's probably right. Then there is Cindy, the show's make up artist and Laura's best friend. She is a rampant womaniser who is on hand to provide a lot of comedy with her dry sense of humour and lady-killing ways. We need your help to bring this story to life and create a pilot to pitch to larger production companies and broadcasters alike.  We would like to film a 45 minute episode and create a strong launch pad that will have everyone who watches it dying to find out what happens next.  We intend to spend the ë£5000 we are asking for on hiring some very talented comic actors to bring the material to life, set building, equipment hire and transport.  We have been fortunate enough to have a lot of very talented people who are lending their time to the project for next to nothing which includes the use of a television studio for free, as well as help from leading names within theë_Britishë_Televisionë_comedy industry.ë_ My name is Alison and I am the producer and writer.  I have been writing this show for the past year inspired by behind the scenes stories from the set of a CBBC programme that a friend of mine worked on many moons ago. The director is emerging comedy director Ian Aryeh who has recently finished his own well received comedy pilot, and is now working on more great comedy content. You can see previous examples of his work here-  ë_. I am investing ë£5000 into the project from my own personal finances so I am very aware ofë_makingë_every penny count and not wasting a cent on unnecessaryë_expenses. Help us make this fantastic, funny and ultimately heart warming comedy about a group of politically incorrect people and the comedy that naturally erupts from working in what should be the most politically correct medium of all, children's television.""",0,8.517193191,0,Film & Video,2012

"Hi! My team and I are making a documentaryë_about an extraordinary, 50 year battle being waged by two very different African families to save their kingdom_Ñés endangered wildlife.ë_ In the small, sovereign, African kingdom of Swaziland, all of the native big game had gone locally extinct as early as 1960 from hunting, poaching, and habitat loss. This was when a young Ted Reilly - now known as the father of Swazi Conservationism - set about to create Swaziland_Ñés first nature sanctuary and bring the animals back. His success eventually won him the support of the beloved late King Sobhuza II, the longest reigning monarch in the known-world, and together they worked to establish Swaziland_Ñés first national park. Due to the support and passion of Swaziland_Ñés current king, King Mswati III, and Ted_Ñés son, Mick, Swaziland has continued to flourish as an international eco-tourist destination and a bastion of rhino safety. But, with the Chinese government recently backing a new ""scientific study"" of rhino horn (giving an implicit nod to otherwise illegal international procurement), it is now worth more than its weight in gold on the international black market, and the result is that surrounding South Africa is currently losing a rhino a day to international organized crime rings. The Rhino Wars have been brought back to Africa, and the fate of Swaziland_Ñés (and the world_Ñés) rhino population hangs in the balance.ë_ To help bring the plight of the rhino to the world_Ñés attention we are also making a pair of ë_educational videos to be released on the web in over a dozen languages, including Mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese, Thai, and Arabic - languages spoken where the illegal markets for rhino horn are the strongest. Our first video can be seen here.ë_ We know rhinos aren_Ñét the cutest animals in the world. (Well,  think they_Ñére pretty cute...) But they are majestic, amazing animals that represent some of our planet_Ñés last great megafauna and stand as a symbol of what our species is doing to every other. Rhinos have existed on this planet for millions of years and have alwaysë_ been a part of the human experience, sparking our imagination and wonder. And now because some have decided that their horns are worth more than gold, we are about to wipe them out.ë_ We don_Ñét want rhinos to disappear - and this is a solvable problem. Through education, legislation, and the development of a global voice we can bring them back from the brink of extinction. In terms of our projects, we_Ñéve already finished filming in Africa and now we_Ñére in the post production phase. Your contribution will make all the difference in just how polished our end result will be and every single cent donated will go straight towards post-production costs. Because everyone has so far worked for free (most especially John Mans, our Emmy-nominated, veteran nature and adventure cinematographer) or for drastically reduced rates, we_Ñéve been able to capture something really remarkable and worthy of reaching as large an audience as possible, and now we just need that final push! Please help us to get the word out about our project and to help turn the tide for the world's rhinos! Thank you! P.S.

BRAINS and BLUFFS is a trivia game that gives players two response options. If a player does not take a card, they must raise their hand and decide whether they will  , or  . Don_Ñét know the answer, but don't want to take a penalty card? Go ahead and raise your hand. If the ASKER doesn't choose you to answer, you're off the hook! Know the answer? Raise that hand! If a player is chosen and gets the answer correct, they get to penalize the ASKER by giving them one of their cards. If a player attempts to BRAIN but gets the answer wrong, they must take TWO cards from the deck, as penalty. After playing with the original deck of Brains and Bluffs for a while, yo and your friends will probably get smarter and know the answers to most of the questions. ë_So to keep you on your toes, here are a few possibilities for expansions packs.

But developing this game, writing the questions, designing the graphics, creating the video, and creating this campaign has been lots of fun.  And there's so much more work that has to be done!  I'm hoping that enough people get behind this, so that BRAINS and BLUFFS becomes a reality. That's also why I've made this card game available for   on our website,  . ë_There's no pieces, or tokens, and I did the work myself, so there was no huge financial investment that I need to recoup. I'm really just hoping people enjoy the game, and if they want a manufactured copy, this Kickstarter campaign will make it possible. We all have our educational weaknesses. But our friends don't really need to know what those are. That's none of their business! So hopefully you will enjoy this game, by showing off what you do know, and lying about what you don't. Let's make this happen! Plus, you know you want a vinyl sticker...""",0,8.517193191,0,Playing Cards,2016
"Fun In The Oven_†¢ has engaging questions and answers to help people get to know each other_Ñ_ maybe a little bit too much about each other!ë_ The game has one deck of 300 cards containing question cards and answer cards.ë_ Each player starts with a hand of 9 answer cards, and the pile of question cards sits in the middle of the group. _ÑÒMom-to-be_Ñù goes first, takes a question card from the deck, and reads it aloud.   The other players select the best answer card they have from their hand and set it face-down in front of the mom-to-be.  Mom-to-be reads her question aloud again then reads all the answers.ë_  She picks the best (often the funniest) answer from the cards played. Whoever played that card wins the round and keeps the question card!  The player to the left of the mother-to-be plays next, and the game continues clockwise. Mom gets to play two answer cards - she's playing for two, after all. At the end of the game the player with the most question cards wins! ë_We recommend at least two full rounds for actual baby showers, and once you see how fun it is, we encourage you to play for hours!ë_ - Everyone who is throwing a baby shower or attending one can have a blast with their friends!  - We are a small team with big dreams of making more fun games for everyone.

"Okay, after watching my amateur video, you're probably thinking ""This girl is NOT a professional."" You're half right. I'm a TERRIBLE videographer! But... I'm a great designer, and I'm extremely adept at translating design into works of laser art.  Like my adorable puppy, Krakken, my laser is small and dependable. But totally not like him at all, it's a bit... slow. I've had to turn down some awesome art jobs because it's just not big enough. I'm raising funds to buy something quite a bit larger and faster. I have quite a few industrial customers, and they are GREAT, but I'm an artist, and my laser is my greatest art tool ever. It's always busy running ""boring"" things to pay the bills, so I don't have a lot of time to tinker and come up with cool new ideas (like this geared card). I currently work in a studio above my garage, and plan on making a new home for the bigger laser right below me. Buh-bye lawnmower... you're being evicted.  What cool stuff can you get out of the deal? Read on, friends!  Once the project is funded and funds are released, I'll start the fulfillment process by sending you a short survey asking for the personalization details necessary to create your order. One of the questions will require your email address so I can send you a proof of your cards. Delivery will take place according to the order in which I receive the completed surveys and proof approvals. Should this campaign exceed my wildest expectations, fulfillment on orders placed later in the process may be slightly delayed, so if you want these right away, order early! One card with all the pertinent deets -- your name, number, and email -- engraved on the black acrylic card. The gears are blank at this level.  At this level, you'll get 5 cards, and the ability to add your logo and add some text to the small wood gear. Phone number, web address, whatever :) Now we're talking. The clear gear is reverse engraved, giving it a bit of depth. Why, because along with every bit of info in level 3, I'll engrave any info you'd like on the flip side of these cards.  Jealous of my laser? It is fairly awesome if I do say so. Let me put it to work for you. With these levels, you get a combination of laser time, design assistance, and graphic design (if you need it), to bring your idea to fruition. (Materials and freight not included. You can drop ship to me and send a prepaid postage label, or I can handle it all and just send you a bill for the extras.)""",0,8.517193191,0,Product Design,2015

"Before we get into the reasons for raising funds, we would like to share with you a small bit of information that inspired us to venture into the world of KickStarter. Yesterday, the story of Nathaniel ""Magnificent"" Montague was not a wildly publicized one. ë_It was a story of perseverance, persistence and identity. ë_In 1956, a book written by Paul Laurence Dunbar changed a native from New Jersey's perspective on life and began a journey that would lead to one of the largest collections of African American art, literature, history and memorabilia in the world. Today, the Montague Collection resurfaces, speaking to over 300 years of the black experience in America. ë_It is extensive and unparalleled in historic content and academic value. ë_Thousands of books, periodicals, slave documents, pamphlets, newspapers and ephemera recording the historical, cultural and inspirational experience of the ""race"" throughout the world exemplifies the special value of the Montague Collection. Today, the story of Nathaniel Montague will not only be told, but will serve as a herald for millions of African American pioneers and those who have yet to be discovered. In the spirit of this collection and its original architect, join us in introducing his story to the world by helping us produce a never before seen limited edition decks of playing cards that will feature over 60 famous inventors, with narratives adapted from the collection, commemorating the achievements of the black experience through ingenuity, innovation and science.

"Hi! My name is Nick Salazar. I am calling on a certain california gurl to ignite my firework. What better way to start a business than to literally get kick-started with a kick in the nuts from Katy Perry?! Yes, that's right! I challenge Ms. Perry to see if she can take a chance and make this dark horse roar! I'm not a fan of her music but she just happens to be headlining our Superbowl halftime show here in Glendale, AZ on February 1, 2015 which is a few blocks where I live. So while she's in town, she'll probably be too peacock chicken to travel a few more blocks to take on this challenge. Or if she choses, (she choses her battles, you know) I can come to her walking on air. She'll probably rather play hackensack with one of the boys under her double rainbow!ë_ Or perhaps she can prove all of us wrong, take on this moment and be here the last Friday night before the big game and help launch a new business with just one touch! Free and clear, no lawyers! Maybe she can make a believer out of me. Honestly, I don't think she's got the courage or the resilience to accomplish this small task! E.T. would already be here kicking away like it's his birthday! With your donations, we can reach our goal and perhaps she can show the world she's not the one that got away and kick-start my teenage dream of launching my clothing brands. It takes two! Brand #1: I've recently started this new journey of fatherhood. I shop for my son's clothes and I see a variety of creative inspirations for mostly girls infants and up. Boys are very limited with this catagory and I would like to change that ASAP! Fathers would be proud to display this unique style for their sons (infants, toddlers, and young men) that impresses. I want to show the world, like fathers like me, when it comes to shopping for our sons, ""this is how we do""! Brand #2: A new universal character for all kids to enjoy. St. Charlie. Kids can either to wear him as clothing or have him as an accessary. Just a little inspiration from a certain monkey and a girly kitty. I would also like to start a cartoon with St. Charlie and post comic strips on StCharlie.com. Your funding will help me start my pre-launching preparations and bring my designs and characters to life. Then using social media, I intend to introduce and expose the brand to the world with mass marketing. We also need to upgrade the current tools and equipment we have to expedite our processes (my frustrating PC is SUPER slow!). We have a few months for this campaign and get everything ready before February. If it is successful, it would be a real honor to have Ms. Perry to accept this challenge and help me launch my new journey. With a kick! My website, stcharlie.com is also a work in progress as a source for more detailed information about the brand, our goals, comic strips, shopping, and other treasures we can think of. I humbly accept any donation going toward our capital and hopefully making our new brand explode like an atomic bomb! I wish I can offer more for your rewards. I can only offer little to what I currently have but perhaps giving more if I indeed get more. Bring us to life, and let's find out together if this signifies our future! So what do ya say Katy? Do you really have the eye of the tiger? Are you gonna run away like you've seen a ghost and don't ever look back?

Montez describes his composing style as _ÑÒsomewhat impressionistic._Ñù  It is similar to Ravel, Poulenc, Debussy, FaurÕ©, and yet seems to have harmonic elements of Puccini, and stylistic elements of Copland and Ralph Van Williams. _ÑÒTruth be told, as much as I love impressionism, it is hard to get the opera out of me.  I like drama, and I love the powerful way opera singers can tell a story. I believe these Biblical stories need to be told in English and not just Latin to a modern audience in a beautiful way. Too many liturgical oratorios are either only available in early music or in ultra-modern forms.  I_Ñém not sure people are being moved by the stories this way...so I don_Ñét apologize for not composing with any sort of atonality.  I want to reach people with the narrative.""

"Newmediator.org is a podcast that discusses art and emerging artists, using new media to reach a wider audience and to showcase the work of diverse artists in order to create and foster a greater artistic community. One of the goals of Newmediator.org is to collaborate with talented artists to show their work to a wider audience, and to serve as a model for other artists and artist communities to harness the power of new media to do so as well. This spring we are going to host our first independent group show, bringing the work of talented emerging artists from across the country together, and we need YOUR help! We are going to be hosting a one-day group show on May 28, 2011. We have already selected talented artists from around the country to participate. The show itself is only one aspect of the overall project; it will be documented digitally and in print, offering the audience an array of options for viewing and interacting with the art. In addition to the live show, which will take place in central New Jersey at a location convenient to public transportation. We will also print a limited addition of a catalog of the works, which will itself be a collaborative artwork, with each one individually signed and numbered. We will also document the exhibition and interviewing the artists for newmediator.org, as well as select donors. The funds from this Kickstarter Project will go to paying for the space rental, the printing of the catalog, and the mailing cost of sending the catalog to each of the donors. How can you participate? You can donate to Newmediator.org's exhibition fund, take part in the catalog, become part of the podcast, join us for the group show, or do all of the above! What makes this project so exciting is that you can support the arts directly, while also supporting artists with different artistic practices and approaches to their work. If you support the arts, want to foster new collaborative projects, and you believe in affordable artwork you should donate to the First Annual Newmediator.org exhibition.

"We are proposing to make a movie depicting a dystopic yet minimalist reality, set in a place of no time, influenced by the hyper real, e.i. various tropes of cinema, contemporary advertising, and all heavily manipulated photographic representation in general. The project is very much scripted but very much inspired by real life. The movie revolves around an upper crust of people who all have some relation to the arts, and a certain level of severity to their post modern lifestyles. One in particular, a gallerist, is curating a show of epic proportions but gets stopped by various forces along the way. The Characters are all searching for the sublime; due to the over circulation and over saturation of notions of the fantasy, the characters are grounded in their reality. Most of them strive to explore many artistic outlets, even beyond the visual arts. The characters circulate through various cities of the world, in a melancholy fashion, trying to remain visible in an era of image consciousness. The camera will also be observing it_Ñés fellow machine, particularly those that move through space and those that possess a means of viewing photographic representation. Machines watching machines, in a post industrial space. The setting of the video will be based around the city of Detroit, in an era when the American Empire has nearly fallen, and due to the civilization_Ñés media and public relations, meaning has fallen off balance.ë_The project has satirically political undertones, with speculations of just how far American style capitalism and consumerism can take the world. The video will be filmed in Detroit, New York, Berlin, and Paris, to create a warped sense of ë_space, and to combine the talents of a team of artists, musicians, and designers from said cities. We are envisioning a depiction of a world with: overstimulation and underwhelmed people, hyperreal surfaces and materials, still lives of food that don_Ñét yet exist, rooms lit only by walls of television screens, sculptural references to influential pieces of cinema, countless available/abandoned spaces, sign holders walking the streets, sign shops on too many corners, advertisements for products that have come and gone, sets that no one is happy about acting in, videos within videos within videos, and a wailing sax accompanied by minimal electronic beats.  To put it simply, the project will strive to be a self-referential, visual symphony that romanticizes space represented on a two-dimensional plane, in all of it_Ñés malleability. This funding would go towards:ë_ the costs of materials for building sets; furniture, sculptures, and other props; the fabrics and tailoring of costumes; equipment for musicians; sculpture transportation; and various purchasing and renting of lighting, camera, and sounds equipment. The figure we are asking for is the minimum needed to complete this project.

"Try explaining _ÑÒCold Turkey_Ñù to a toddler.  After months of watching his toddler daughter suck away at a  pacifier, Chris began to worry about the negative effects pacifier attachment might have on her development. He noticed that Elizabeth  (aka Bubba) wasn't speaking as much as other children her age.  As  an anxious first-time dad, Chris asked his wife, a pediatrician, for an answer to their problem. ""What do I buy to help her give up  her pacifier?"" Unfortunately he didn't like the diagnosis; there wasn't a  product available and all that they could do was tough it out and force  her to quit cold turkey.    Forcing  a child to give up their pacifier ""cold turkey"" isn't easy or fun,  unless you enjoy sleepless nights and enduring psychotic toddler rage  and tantrums. One friend recommended cutting down the nipple, but  when Chris asked if they ever worried about their kid choking, their  response: ""I guess I never thought about that!"" made him pass on their  parenting wisdom.ë_ Unfortunately, there was no easy or safe alternative available to help reduce the trauma and drama associated with pacifier  detachment. Until now!  With the help of his wife, other pediatricians, dentists, and friends, Chris developed Bye Bye Bubba. Bye Bye Bubba is a transitional pacifier system consisting of three BPA free pacifiers designed to aid parents in weaning children off their pacifiers. Children are attached to their pacifiers because of the soothing effect the suction provides. The more challenging it is to maintain suction, the less enjoyable their pacifier becomes.  A child begins with Stage 1: A traditional size nipple pacifier used for one week. After the first, comes Stage 2: A similar pacifier with a slightly shorter nipple is also used for one week. Lastly, Stage 3: The final one-week stage, uses another similar pacifier but with a significantly smaller nipple than the previous stages. At this point maintaining suction is extremely challenging. By the completion of Week 3, children either self-select to abandon or parents opt to remove the pacifier. At this time, with their child, parents can finally say: _ÑÒBye Bye Bubba._Ñù Prototypes below give an idea of size and structure (stages 1-3):ë_""",0,11.50014413,0,Product Design,2015

"Since a child, I've had two constant interests in my life. One was for animals--I've collected and read numerous books regarding the study of animals as well as fictional stories in which animals where prominent characters. I've also loved to draw and I especially like cartoons and animation. So I finally got with Pat and discussed combining these passions and talents into a new line of critter miniatures. The result is a fantastic list of cute critters of many animal types from many popular genres, including Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Western, and more, that we hope you'll enjoy. The core set begins with several characters with medieval Asian influence, but stretch goals will encompass various other genres. Care is taken to size the figures so they are compatible with other models from the most popular manufacturers within the 28mm to 32mm range of heroic scale sizes. KritterKinsÕ¢ë†ë¢ are cast in high quality pressure-cast urethane resin that reproduces almost exactly the detail of the original sculpt. All models are supplied unpainted and some assembly may be required. Why return to Kickstarter? We have all of the models shown ready to go into production, but molding, mastering, and casting runs are expensive. It would take us longer to raise the funds to put these models into production over time than if we ask for funds to make a collection of them at one time. We want to get these models out to you as soon as possible, and through Kickstarter, YOU can make that possible.

As a fan and a filmmaker, I recorded footage of the memorial and posted my   to YouTube. To this day I receive comments on the video from fans all over the world expressing their love for Elliott and their thanks for making a tribute video for him. To date the video has attracted nearly 750,000 views. There is a strong fan base for Elliott's music, even eight years after his death. His music is being discovered by fans who haven't heard of him until now.

" follows the story of Norman (Paul Salvetti), an insecure and anti-social History teacher, whose daily monotonous life is disrupted by the arrival of Astrid (Stephanie van Rijn), the new art teacher. As their ideologies and social strategies collide, both will learn the value of friendship and trust in an unexpected turn of events that will show them that sticking to what they know is not always the best way to deal with problems in life, and that sometimes all you need is a different perspective.  Norman will learn how to come out of his shell and Astrid will have to deal with her soon-to-be ex-husband Zeke (Billy Peck), former front man of a Rock Band, as he attempts to regain his grip over her.   All in all,   is a comedic drama that is sure to bring a smile on your face, some good laughs and most importantly, a beautiful message that will touch your heart. We are a group of independent filmmakers and actors driven by passion and determination. Our objective is to share our art, our perspective. We want to send to all of you out there, a message that will hopefully reach out and spread through out the world. We had previously been working in short films and smaller projects, and just a few months ago we decided to take the big step: Our first feature film. It wasn't an easy step to take but we trusted each other and we all jumped right into it without hesitation, and on July 22nd, 2013 we started shooting the film. With a great script written by Stephanie van Rijn, our locations locked down (Special thanks to the Raritan Valley Community College!) and our main team assembled, we proceeded to getting the shoot done, and in the blink of an eye we were making our dream come true! The story we had visualized was now becoming real... After a few weeks after hard work, great performances, meeting new people, expanding our team and very long shooting days, we made it. We shot our first feature film!  But that's not the end of the story... Shooting a film is just step 2 in the process. We have our footage, our raw material, now it's time to shape it into a real film! But we can't do it without help, and this is where Kickstarter comes in. We need your help to raise funds necessary to finish this film. These funds include post-production, sound editing, mixing, music composing, festival entries and of course, what's required for us to deliver all the perks we're offering in this campaign! With your help we'll be able to finish this feature film and also we'll have the chance to offer public screenings in festivals and in local theaters in New York, Ohio, Mexico, Montreal among other locations. The great thing that Kickstarter offers is the chance for our potential audience to get involved with the project. People are no longer just spectators waiting in line to see the film, they can actually be part of it! Have you ever wanted to go watch a film and tell your friends: ""Hey I helped that movie! I was part of this!""? Well now you'll have the chance to do it! Not only do you get to be part of this project, but if you check the right side bar, you'll see our additional rewards and perks for helping the production, ranging from DVD copies shipped right to your home, to hand made items forged by our lead actor himself (Yes, G. Paul Salvetti is not only an actor, he's a skilled blacksmith as well, and he is willing to give YOU a treat) and some props used in the film itself! Not enough? How about tickets to our different private screenings, the chance to hang out with cast and crew at these events and some Producer credits on IMDB and at the end of the film? We appreciate your help and we want you to know it. With your support you're not just a backer, you become part of our team, our family.

"Dabble is a limited print poster project consisting of seven motives that tell individual stories in a light and humorous way. My intent is to amuse you through the stories that each motive tells and above all my ambition is not to make you think too hard, but rather to make you wonder a little. If my illustrations can trigger a new thought or even make you smile - well, that is my motivation! The motives or   are minimalistic in their expression, consist of few colours, clean lines and all illustrate a playful duality between our world and the creatures in them. The stories they tell are open to interpretation and I invite you to play with the what's and the why's. My ambition has been to create motives that do not scream for attention, but rather add a subtle something to wherever you might place or hang them. The dabbles will be of limited print and if this turns out to be something you guys like, I_Ñéll be creating a new series in the future, perhaps even going into other mediums and sizes. The scope of this project is to print one hundred A3 posters of each motive.ë_If all goes according to plan, you will have your limited dabble prints sometime in may of this year. Every dabble will be hand-numbered from one to one hundred. Once again I find myself smiling in bewilderment! Thank you so much for kickstarting dabble in a big way. I am so very grateful to all who have backed this project. With your pledges dabble will now live outside kickstarter for at least one year. Every backer will be receiving a special edition dabble that I shall commence working on this very weekend (which I_Ñém looking forward to!!).   We_Ñéve now got dabble online, I wonder if we can put the dabbles into a physical space. The next and   stretch goal focuses on balancing out the prior expenses of this campaign and acquiring seven frames to be used at future exhibitions.   If we reach this goal, every backer will receive a special mention on the dabble website and a unique chance to grab future dabble illustrations at a special discount. ë_ Wow! Initial goal reached within a week _Ñ_ my words are gone! I_Ñém grateful, proud, happy and also humbled at the same time_Ñ_ It is a surreal experience. A sincere thank you to all that have backed this project so far :-)! Where to go from here? Well, I_Ñéve looked into how much backing it would take to launch dabble into the ""real world"" and created a stretch goal for that purpose. Reaching this will ensure that dabble lives in its very own web shop for a year. If dabble reaches its stretch goal, I_Ñéve got something in the works for all you awesome backers who've pledged a dabble! Namely a completely unique dabble with the three most popular dabbles, combined into one print. You will be the only ones receiving this dabble, think of it as a limited extra special edition illustration, from me to you :-)! The below chart illustrates the entire costs of dabble so far, also including the prior costs(greyed out) to starting this campaign and are not a part of the   goal.ë_ Add a few hundred hours of sketching, illustrating, feedbacking, clipping, reworking, iterating ... and you have seven dabbles :-)!ë_ If you'd like, I'll happily meet up with you and hand over your print in person - I'd love to hear why you backed this project and how you interpret the different motives.ë_""",0,8.967121656,1,Illustration,2016

Along the way, we've shared BackStories-in-development in performances at Sadler's Wells (London, UK), Cooltour (Ostrava, CR) and Goldsmiths, University of London.

"Sure, you know some blues music. Maybe you even know some blues dancing. But did you know that both have been around since the 1800s? In that time, ""The Blues"" has come to mean a lot more than just a style of music and dance. It's the product of a uniquely American culture, has a literary tradition all its own, has evolved into a wide variety of forms and subgenres, and continues to be an integral part of the fabric of this country. As Blues and Lindy in the Panhandle (BLIP), we work to introduce people to the richness of the genre. There are wonderful blues dance workshops and exchanges all over the world; our goal at BLIP is to take this to the next level, offering a weekend of not only dance instruction and social dancing, but classes that tell the stories behind the music, the historical contexts that birthed blues, the conjoined history of the music and the dance, and so much more. As we have studied these things, we have found ourselves enjoying the dancing and the music a great deal more, and it's our hope to share that with you. A lifelong dancer, Damon learned vernacular blues and jazz dance first from his grandmother, grew up to study a variety of dance styles, and came full circle to study the history and style of swing and blues idiom dancing. He has taught blues dancing as a featured instructor on five continents, and is widely recognized as an authority on the history of blues dance. We're pleased to have him as an instructor for both dance and dance history. When you think of a blues harmonica player and a university professor of southern studies, you don't often think of the same person, but Adam Gussow wears both hats professionally. As Dr. Gussow, he teaches courses at Ole Miss in blues tradition and American and African American literature; as Adam he plays harmonica with Alan Gross in ""The Blues Doctors"" or with Sterling Magee as ""Satan and Adam."" He will be sharing with us some of the cultural history surrounding the blues and its expression in music and literature, performing at the evening dances, and even offering a beginner harmonica workshop! Unquestionably among the best blues dancers and instructors in the southeast, Laura is also known as an excellent DJ and organizer, leading the annual Winter Blues event in Greenville, SC.ë_Laura loves the rich history and culture of blues, and she can_Ñét wait to share that treasure during her classes. She believes dancing is for everyone and wants to see it inspire confidence and individuality in each of her students. No matter what she_Ñés doing, her goal is to bring people together and help them experience joy whether they_Ñére dancing alone or with a partner. Rebecca began her study of Lindy Hop in 1998. She is an active teacher, dancer, lecturer, and judge in both academic and social dance circles. She earned her MA in dance history, writing her thesis on the Texas Tommy, at Florida State University_Ñés renowned dance department. As a social dancer she specializes in Lindy Hop, Blues, Vernacular Jazz, Charleston, Balboa, Shag, and many of the Rag dances of the 1910s. While originally from Cleveland, she currently resides in Tallahassee with her husband Michael and two- almost three - children. She has enjoyed judging Lindy here in the Southeast and teaching as an adjunct faculty of dance at Florida State University and Tallahassee Community College.

In their everyday lives, Beau is a Recreation Supervisor, Marylu is a Special Education Teacher and Art works for a family owned business making deliveries. They have also built an award winning BBQ competition team and have been competing in BBQ competitions for about 7 years. Beau has grown hops in his own back yard successfully for about five years and uses his hops in the home brews he creates with Marylu and Art. The farm has been in Marylu's family for many years, originally serving as a horse farm. ŒæAs the horses have moved on to greener pastures, we are looking to repurpose this land. Although there are 12 acres waiting to be farmed, we are starting small! ŒæOur plan is to build a 1/4 acre hop yard using as much material existing on the property as possible. We will be building our hop trellis using naturally rot resistant locust trees from the farm. We will irrigate the property from a natural spring fed pond on the property as well as collections in rain barrels. We have had the soil tested and have a great soil scientist at our disposal, should we need one. ŒæAdditionally, we are hoping to use solar energy to power the pump and irrigation system. Œæ Once our hops have grown and have been family harvested, they will be dried to a 10% moisture content in the Oast House and be prepared for sale. ŒæOur hops will be marketed to local NJ breweries as well as home brewers. The rhizomes themselves can be sold to others who may be interested in having their own hop garden! ŒæWe also plan to make hop candy, hop tea and hop vine wreaths which we hope will be sold at a local farmers market. ŒæOnce the hop plants are established, their rhizomes can be divided and replanted, creating even more hops. The farm can keeping growing and growing! There are two reasons! 1) We love to home brew but have always had to purchase hops from the midwest. We have created some great beers (after much practice), but we really wanted to make a FANTASTIC beer from only local ingredients. Problem was, there were no local hop farms. So, we started growing our own. It was such a neat feeling to know that we had developed our own recipes locally grown ingredients. We want to share this with others and give them the chance to craft locally.ŒæThere is a huge resurgence in creating your own beer recipes and it would be totally cool to use local hops! Our hope is that by supplying our hops to local breweries and home brewers who want to use locally grown ingredients, we will help other local businesses (and dreams) survive.ŒæWe have all already invested much time and money into this dream of ours, but we need some support to keep it going. ŒæWe feel strongly about reviving a love of crafting local beers as well as bringing back a little bit of farming to the Garden State.Œæ 2) It amazes us as parents that so many of our childrens' friends have never been to a farm! We are so excited to teach our children, who already love to garden, how to work on a farm. They have already started working with us on the farm and have so enjoyed themselves that they share it with their friends, who are in turn getting excited! ŒæAs we learn, they will learn and we hope that they will grow to have a loving respect for the value of farming and we plan to share our experiences and love to people in the community. Your backing will help us continue our building of this farm and sharing the experience with our community. ŒæIt will assist in buying hop plants, cable for the trellis system, rain barrels and the irrigation system, as well as sharing and teaching what we learn to other adults and children interested in the community. Can't afford to give? You can ""Like"" us on Facebook, send emails to your friends, and talk about us and our endeavor to bring back farming! In short, there are three: Goal #1 - create a sustainable hop farm to provide local breweries and home breweries with great fresh, local hops. Goal #2 - Teach our children and members of our community the importance of farming and hopefully instill such a love, that they will want to farm, too! Goal #3 - We want to grow! Hops are our interest and we want our hop farm to grow, but it would be SO cool if our children or members of our community would like a piece of property to farm themselves or create a community garden. We would love to be able to create enough revenue that we could ultimately share the space with others for their creative farming desires! Prior to 1909, the Northeastern United States was the leading producer of hops in the country. The Dewey blight of 1909 decimated the crop and a subsequent aphid infestation caused even more damage to the hop industry in the Northeast. Then along came prohibition, which put the final nail in the coffin of commercial hop production. As time passed hop production moved to the West Coast, leaving the East Coast behind. ŒæWe have decided to breathe new life into the industry by building a small scale production facility that will provide fresh, locally grown hops to consumers in the central New Jersey area.Œæ This project is designed to be a family affair! Our children and extended family will all participate in the planting, harvesting, drying and packaging of the hops. ŒæBy doing this we are hoping that their investment in the farm will lead them to grow and nurture it for many years to come. ŒæPlease help us on our journey as we try to bring ""throwback farming"" to central New Jersey.""",1,8.517193191,1,Food,2012

"To Our Supporters and Friends:  My name is Bryant and I am one of the founders of NorthBourne Foods, a food supply company located in Houston Texas. The one thing that I have learned over the years while working in various capacities in the food industry is that people need and should come first, but in many cases, less fortunate people don't. We have devoted our business to providing services to everyone, including those in places that generally don't have the resources for the highest quality food products available. We are dedicated to seeking out food deserts and delivering our line of quality foods into the local shelters, schools, restaurants, small independent grocers, and individuals including the elderly who live within these communities.  There is nothing greater than serving everyone with quality, healthy, and affordable food products, especially the less fortunate !  How we came to this point:  NorthBourne Foods was founded in 2010 ( ) on the principal of providing healthy food products to all. We are a small family run business and our customers include public school systems, restaurants, small independent grocers, and individuals.  Since entering the business we have been very disappointed with food products in the market especially products geared towards poverty stricken communities and the less fortunate. These food products do not meet the same quality standards as those stores and restaurants in communities that include median to high income earners.ë_ Everyone deserves healthy food: We find it disappointing that many food suppliers servicing lower income communities rarely supply the same high quality foods that they enjoy with their very own families. Even more disturbing is that many of the products served to impoverished communities or within food deserts are not raised or produced in the same manner that higher quality foods are produced for those living in higher economic areas.   NorthBourne Foods would like to bring changes into communities that have been labeled as food deserts simply because we care about all of our consumers including the elderly and especially the youngest consumers, OUR CHILDREN. Quality foods shouldn't be an option depending on income, it should be mandatory.  We know that all consumers - people, care a great deal about the foods that they eat and their health. Because of the lack of quality food products in these communities NorthBourne Foods has found itself in a unique but positive position to help support healthy good eating habits one community at a time. For us, it_Ñés not good enough to accept substandard meats and produce from ranchers and farmers or those processed food manufacturers in an effort to maximize their earning potential.  What human being really wants to eat foods produced or slaughtered in a cheap substandard manner?ë_ We all deserve Quality Food Products: Our company has decided to take complete control of our product line which consist of fresh beef, poultry, lamb, pork, goat and a full line of fresh fruits and vegetables. We have worked extremely hard to gain positive partnerships with small family owned farms to manage our hand selected livestock and we are equally hands-on with suppliers and farmers providing our line of high quality produce. In fact, we embrace farmers and ranchers that share our same philosophy for high quality food products and the community.  What we need:  We currently need to buy two quality pre-owned refrigerated cargo vans. This campaign will cover one van. Since we are a small family run business we have been utilizing contracted vans and trucks for delivery into low income areas and food deserts, which are generally non-profitable and become costly with transportation cost. This is extremely difficult and doesn't allow for much flexibility without having to raise prices to amounts too high for the average consumer in these areas. As we stated before ""We want everyone to be able to afford ""GOOD QUALITY FOOD"" .  The vans would help us to eliminate the huge expense of contracted or rented refrigerated trucks for daily deliveries. Having the vans would not only keep our overhead down when going into lower income communities but it would also allow us from time-to-time to provide surplus donations from our stock to charitable organizations within those communities without the worry of vehicle rental expense. Overall it would also allow us to expand delivery hours and move into impoverished and more isolated areas where the majority of food deserts are located.  The Plan:  We would like to expand delivery with our own vans to areas considered ""food deserts"" and we would also like to offer lower cost and high quality products to individuals within these communities, schools, grocers and smaller restaurants which usually can't afford to buy healthy products.  Getting funding for the vans will help us to take a GIANT LEAP towards serving everyday people living in lower economically strapped neighborhoods with great tasting meats, poultry, fruits and vegetables .... HEALTHY FOOD PRODUCTS. In advance, we greatly thank you so much and we appreciate your support, encouragement and HOPE !  Get the word out:  Please don't feel bad if you aren't in a position to donate funds. You can still help us to serve the community by getting the word out to as many people as possible. We greatly appreciate all of your effort as well !""",1,7.495541944,0,Food,2014

Cambodian cuisine is characterized by contrasts: fresh and cooked, sweet, sour and salty. It uses fresh vegetables and doesn_Ñét rely on tons of fat or frying. I think it_Ñés different from Thai food in this way. During the Khmer Rouge, Cambodian cuisine was nearly lost, but now it_Ñés making a comeback, becoming popular in New York and around the world.

I_Ñéve already purchased the trailer so your pledges will be used to purchase commercial kitchen equipment and get the trailer ready for business. I want to reward you, my backers, for believing in me and Cambodian food, so every dollar pledged will be returned, doubled, in the form of a punch card redeemable for menu items from the Bai trailer. For example, if you pledge $25, you_Ñéll get $50 worth of food. You are basically just buying gift cards for Cambodian food before the trailer is ready. Your pledges will be doubled as my way of saying thank you. For pledges of $200 or more, I will bring the Bai trailer to your home or business and cater a dinner for you and 5 of your friends. I_Ñéll take care of everything. This is a significant discount on catering prices once the trailer is open for business. If you want to support this project but don_Ñét live in Montana, or know someone who does, pledge $25 and I_Ñéll send you an authentic Cambodian krama scarf. These kramas are hand loomed and great for spring or fall. I feel very fortunate to live in the United States, and I want to form a non-profit organization to help women and children in Cambodia. I plan to use the Bai food trailer to raise awareness of issues faced by women in home country and to raise funds for projects there. By supporting this Kickstarter project, you will not just be helping to bring Cambodian food to Montana, but also helping those in need in Cambodia.""",1,9.104979856,1,Food,2014

We presently have the opportunity to print a batch run on giant sheets, dramatically reducing the overall price of the printrun. And by increasing our run size, we are also able to special order a more environmentally responsible paper, direct from the mill. This awesome new paper is thicker, with a beautiful matte finish perfect for coloring! This will be the FIRST TIME EVER that we've been able to offer our complete collection! We're celebrating by sharing THE ENTIRE SET OF POSTERS, complete with their accompanying storybook narratives as well as a special LIMITED RUN COLOR POSTER (exclusively for our Kickstarter backers), for pledges of $100, including shipping! Check it out... there's all sorts of great packages offered for different pledge amounts! OUR KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN  We've set our goal at a conservative $5,000, but every bit-o-honey helps us cover the total $12,000 cost of the project. This will be our largest, and most diverse print run to date. Many of these posters will be gifted to organizations and communities on the front lines of the environmental and social justice struggles they depict. Despite our impressive ""pollination"" efforts that have worked to scatter many tens of thousands of posters internationally, we're actually just a very small, enthusiastic, do-it-ourselves outfit with less than 5% annual grant funding. We pull off our unlikely feats of cooperation and D.I.Y. production ONLY because of the grassroots donations we receive from folks like yourself! Every poster we print functions as a powerful seed, both as a fundraising AND an organizing tool that keeps our unique ""organism"" afloat, and constantly evolving. CROSS-POLLINATING THE GRASSROOTS  We make pictures that are refreshingly sincere, truthful, and accessible to everyone (regardless of language, education, or literacy). We choose quirky, hilarious, and often heartbreaking metaphors drawn from the natural world and the landscape of corporate globalization to illustrate ""bad news"" topics. We also document under-recognized ""good news"" stories of communities fighting to defend their lands- and their lives- from colonizing forces. We work in deep collaboration with affected communities, and regularly visit hundreds of audiences per year with engaging picture-lectures and storysharing workshops. Though we tackle heavy, complicated issues, people constantly say that our heartfelt and compelling imagery helps make ""bad news"" more digestible, and inspires community dialogue, critical reflection, and strategic action... and well, they're also just damn crazy cool-lookin' posters! Thanks so much for your support, y'all! We're SO delighted to share this work with you! Learn more about the Bees at  .  Visit our Webstore at   to see our posters!

"Zombie My Heart is a short film about how blind love can really be. ë_Our protagonist has just lost the love of his life, we find him in despair when suddenly he meets someone new. Someone exciting, someone different. Someone... who is a zombie? ë_Will he continue to live in denial, caring only about his love for this woman, or will he listen to his friends and realize there's something not quite right about her? Way Up There Productions is a film production company founded on June 14, 2011 by a group primarily consisting of college students, each with different backgrounds all relating to various aspects of filmmaking. ë_Our first major project was Obsession (2012). We raised $1285 (minus fees) of the budget on Kickstarter and with the addition of external funding the final budget of Obsession came to $2111.04. ë_Zombie My Heart is our second major project and we have returned to kickstarter to raise money to fund this second endeavor.

Our minimum barebones budget is $1200 which is enough to cover the essentials. ë_The initial goal is more then our last film, however our last film's goal ($750) was exceeded and $1285 was pledged. ë_The reason the initial goal is higher is that we will be shooting outdoors and that entails all sorts of additional equipment needs. ë_We have a great camera from our last Kickstarter project, however we need to purchase several pieces of equipment such as a matte box and french flags to better use it outdoors. ë_We also plan to purchase lapel mics and a field recorder to improve the sound quality over our last project. ë_Lastly we will use the funds to purchase props, costumes, and special effects make-up to bring our zombie to life! ë_ë_However if we exceed that goal (we've made an ideal budget for $2000) we can afford all the props, costumes, special effects make-up, and locations that we need. ë_If we exceed the ideal goal then we will be able to come up with additional stretch goals for you, our backers.

"Too strong?ë_ OK... you will, at least, get the opportunity to invest in the ""first-of-it's-kind"" program that focuses on driving proficiency with one of the most disruptive communication services in history... ë_ First and foremost, Skype for Business is NOT Skype!ë_ If you're thinking, SKYPE SUCKS, I hear you.ë_ You are not alone in this thinking! Most small and medium sized businesses are spending more money than necessary on their virtual meetings. ë_Yes, they are cheaper than meetings of old that required expensive air travel and lodging... not to mention the time away from the office, BUT... today, money is still being wasted! ë_If you are among the tens of millions of Office 365 users, and you use popular virtual meeting services, such as GoToMeeting or WebEx, you are wasting your money... many of you may actually be using multiple solutions across your company. These services are quite popular, and for good reason... they work! ë_The problem is that they are no longer needed if you are among the legions of Office 365 users.  ë_ Skype for Business is now a part of Office 365, Microsoft's fastest-growing commercial product in history.ë_ Many who purchase Office 365 fail to take full advantage of the productivity enhancements that are possible with the tightly-integrated Skype for Business service. ë_What is often purchased as a hosted email service, and for the licenses to our old friends Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, Office 365 offers so much more! ë_ë_ We are currently seeking to fill a major void in the unified communications space. While I have run my company, Plum Unified Communications, LLC ( ) for the past 2 years as a communications consultancy, I am launching this campaign to fund the develop of an in-house practice that focuses on providing practical and immersive instruction on Skype for Business.  Am I qualified?ë_ Of course I think so!ë_ You be the judge...ë_ The TEDx talk below was delivered in October 2015 and give you an idea of my style and passion.ë_ WARNING:ë_ It might not be for everyone (a bit snarky at times). We will do way more than walk thru the features of the service. We will take a hands-on deep dive to uncover productivity enhancements for Office 365 users that can only be found with this service, courtesy of its tight integration with the Office suite of services. ë_Did you know you can actually send a chat/IM right from an Excel spreadsheet? To see if this campaign is worthy of your attention, here are some questions to ask yourself: ë_ If the answer to any of these questions is ""YES"", then please read on... You are going to love this! Our unique, flagship offering will be the Skype for Business User Bootcamp, a live, online workshop delivered in an immersive, 4-hour session. The bootcamp is designed specifically for those who use Office 365, but are not yet fully leveraging Skype for Business, which is tightly integrated (and, depending on the license, at no added cost). Students will gain practical, hands-on instruction that will ensure that all who participate will understand the ""how"", as well as the ""why"", when it comes to getting the most out of their collaboration solution.ë_ While not yet sanctioned by Microsoft, our Skype for Business User Bootcamp will be run more like a hyper-focused Customer Immersion Experience (CIE) session than a typical online classroom setting. ë_Each student will have their own live account to use during the session. ë_To ensure optimal involvement for each student, class size will be limited to 15. We will facilitate various exercises designed specifically to allow the student to uncover the powerful and effective collaboration features built right into the service. Thanks to the rewards offered with this campaign, you can personally benefit by eliminating unnecessary spending on virtual meeting software in your own company.ë_ That's a good motivator, BUT... thanks to Kickstarter, you can contribute to a larger movement that will move the needle to educate Office 365 users (there are now 70 million and counting) on the power of the tools that they have already purchased.ë_ In this case, a little bit of specialized knowledge will go a long way to saving hundreds of thousands in needless spending.ë_ Remember, every person we touch has the potential to save $500 per year!  - Jenni H.""",0,9.433483923,0,Software,2016

We need to raise $400,000 (or more because the more we raise the greater the experience for you) to finish pre-production and start filming on A Better Place and you can grab this chance with us.  Thanks to a couple of private donations, we have started some of our pre-production on the movie.  But we still need you to give A Better Place the chance it deserves!  Together we can do this!ë_ If we make our goal, we will post a video of 3 of us jumping into a tank of jello or ice water (it will be your pick, majority will rule) and share it with all of you! ë_And if we make over goal by $50,000 minimum, we will do it in drag! ë_So start thinking now if you want to see jello or ice water! What was high school like for you?  Was it good, bad, easy, hard?  A Better Place is a movie based on the book ""A Better Place"" by Mark Roeder, which is also his number 1 selling book. Please join us in helping to show that it is possible to start a project with a show of support on Kickstarter.  A Better Place is an opportunity for real growth and an invitation to challenge your friends to help back a great project.  A Better Place will show some of the hardships that a gay person may face in real life and hopefully show those that might be going through the exact same thing that if they hold on, there is A Better Place out there and that they too will find it.  This movie will be inspiring and an uplifting hour and a half journey of discovery!ë_ Think back to when you were in school.  Were you the one always picked on and the loner?  Maybe you were the most popular or a cheerleader or jock?  Maybe you were gay and having to hide it for fear of what might happen.  Did high school bring you a lot of pain and hardships?  If so, you will be able to relate to this movie when it is complete and it just might help show others going through what you went through that there is A Better Place out there.ë_ ë_A Better Place is a gay love story about two boys that are from two different worlds who struggle to find themselves in a whirlwind of confusion. Can the strength that they find in each other be enough for them to overcome the hatred and abuse from others as they struggle through betrayals and hardships, friendships and heartbreaks, to find the deepest desire of their hearts.ë_ For Casper high school is not a great experience.  Casper is the ""invisible"" and poorest boy in high school.  He is bullied by those around him, his father is distant, and his older brother makes his life a living hell in many ways.  For Brendan high school is a wonderful experience.  Brendan is the varsity football team captain who has it all, fame, muscles, popularity, and money.  Brendan begins to take an interest in Casper, sending their friendship in a whole new direction.  Brendan learns firsthand what Casper goes through.  Being disowned by his parents and even locked up in a psychiatric hospital.  Casper and Brendan share nothing in common on the surface, but under each of their reputations is a yearning to be free and to find a better place.  They set off to leave their troubles behind them as they head out on a long journey to find a better place  to live.  They will meet many obstacles on their journey and find new friends along the way.ë_ #1 Selling book for Mark.

Filming will be taking place in South Dakota, mainly the South East part of South Dakota.  Please join us on this journey!ë_ Here are 3 story boards we have worked on:ë_ So, _ÑÒwhat will my donation go towards_Ñù you might be wondering.  Well, here it is:ë_ Short version: Your donations will help us to cover some of the costs of Pre-Production, shooting, visual FX, props and costumes, studio and sets, equipment, talent (both actors and crew), post-productions, insurance, and any unforeseen costs that might come up during the making of this film.ë_ Long Version: some of the things that your funding will help to cover include, cameras, video monitors, boom equipment, light meter, color meter, stedicam, audio equipment like a field mixer and digital recorder, the purchase of costumes for the cast to wear, insurance should anything happen on set we want to make sure everyone is covered as well as other legal stuff, post production to do sound design, color correction, etc., pay for the cast and crew since they will not want to do this for free and we want to have a great ensemble for the cast for you to enjoy, craft services since everyone needs to eat on set and we don_Ñét want anyone to starve during production, cost for the film rights to the book, costs to build sets as well as to use locations, cost for the rights to music that will be in the film, travel to get everyone and all the equipment to and from locations, costs to enter and take A Better Place in film festivals like Sundance, and costs associated with initially producing DVD's and Blueray_Ñés.  Uncle Sam also wants a percent of what we raise as well.  So we have to take this into account for our figures on how much we need as well.  This is just some of the many things that funding will go to.  Most importantly anything left over after we are done filming will be given to other projects on Kickstarter to help them out! ë_Be sure to look at the perks on the right for full details on the perks bellow! You might be asking yourself, _ÑÒwhat do I get in return._Ñù  Take a look at the right and you will see what you can get in return depending on the amount of your donation!  The goals are also based on if full funding is meet.  So make sure to spread the word.  How about those goals that include travel like a set visit, etc.  The dates are subject to scheduling, and travel and accommodations are not included for all of them.  So read them carefully.  We hope they will be a great experience for you!  You might also be wondering how come we are giving away so many digital perks and not many physical.  Well, the reason for that is, one, to keep our costs down.  The more physical perks we give away, the less money we have to produce a great film for you because we would have to use some of the money to produce and ship your perks to you.  And two, for each physical perk we send to you, we have to send a percent to Uncle Sam in taxes.  And we don_Ñét know about you, but we know we want to make you a great movie that you will love and hope you back us on that as well as understand!ë_ Every single dollar counts and every new contributor adds to our success and your experience!  It helps to add more shooting days, better talent (actors and crew) etc. to this project to make sure that we turn out the best project that we can for you!  So please, grab this chance today, and then ask 10 of your friends to also grab this chance!  Besides any perks you might get, we also want you to know how appreciative we are for backing us, so we will also be saying thank you to you on our Facebook page as well as our Twitter account and on a special page on our website.  Plus, if we can find you on Facebook, we will also send you a special thank you on your page as well!ë_ My name is John and I have formed Howling Moon Productions.

We are going to be a small production company set in South Dakota producing small budget films and eventually commercials for local TV stations. A Better Place is going to be our launching film for Howling Moon Productions. In the beginning we will be based out of my home, and then eventually as we grow we will be based out of our own building.ë_ We are looking forward to bringing you our first great movie that you are going to want to watch again and again.  We are hoping that you will want to make this journey with us!  The book is inspiring to read and we want to movie to be just as inspiring.  We want the movie to be our way of sharing the book with you!  Because of this, in the end, the movie will be a great product for everyone that watches it and we are the perfect ones to do this for you!  We are privileged to share this project with you and look forward to making it happen together.ë_ I have always had a passion for the film industry studying everything I can about films in books and online. I have had small parts in local productions for the local college, USD, as well as directing a small production for my high school to advertise a new class that they created and that I was taking part in. It was in this class that I also got a chance to study at the local TV station, SDPB, South Dakota public broadcasting station. Besides studying film as I was growing up, I also, for fun, created special effects on the computer in my free time on everything from Star Trek to my own creations.ë_ ë_While growing up, my family did not have much money. So the only production equipment I ever got to mess around with was an old VHS camcorder, two VHS machines set up side by side to do editing with. I had no way to put the film on computer to do much more editing than that. Because of this, I never had the chance to follow my dreams and passion in life. I am so excited to be creating Howling Moon Productions so that I may continue to follow my passion in life and have the proper equipment to do what I love.ë_ Howling Moon Productions is a South Dakota based Indie Production Studio that will distribute films produced by the business to customers in its targeted markets starting with A Better Place.ë_ ë_Currently A Better Place is in script and funding stage. The script is being written while we raise funding for the project. After funding is raised, we will be purchasing all the necessary equipment that will be needed and start the rest of pre-production, scouting locations for the shoot, setting up contracts with places we will be filming in and at, putting out casting calls for cast and crew, etc. We hope to start filming in June or July of 2015 with a release date for the film of June 2016.ë_ ë_The film will be available to purchase as a digital download and on DVD and Blueray. We are also going to submit the film to a couple of film festivals as well. Most rewards will be sent out after the film is complete. The reason for this is because one, if you are getting a copy of the movie, obviously we cannot send it out if it is not finished, and two, if we send out say the script before the film is finished, then you already know what is going to happen, or others might know if the script gets leaked.ë_   Right now the film is budgeted at roughly around $385,000 which includes things like the cost of equipment that will be needed, purchasing rights to things like music for the film, paychecks for cast and crew, as well as cost to produce and send out rewards for backing the project, etc. This is the bare minimum for us to create a great experience for you.  Anything lower than that and we might as well not make the movie because it would look as if it was done on a cell phone. Lol  This does not include the fee from Kickstarter if we are successful with our campaign as well as any taxes that Uncle Sam is going to want from the money since he always wants his cut in everything, including crowd funding if it is over a certain amount. We have also signed up with   so any funding left over after our project is done will be paid forward to other projects on Kickstarter!  All backers will get to follow a special Twitter account for A Better Place. This is where you will get to see what we are doing that day on the set as well as follow the production of the film and at times tweet with the cast during production. The goal is to enter A Better Place into several film festivals to get the most media coverage for our screenings as possible.  The film festivals include Sundance, Atlanta Film, Berlin & Beyond, Bel Air, Boston, Boulder, and more. """,0,12.89921983,0,Romance,2015

"WHAT It_Ñés an art exhibition with music, and it_Ñés a concert inside an art installation. It_Ñés a collaboration project between architect/video installation artist Jungwan Bae and photographer/musician Oan Kim and their respective collaborators, VJ Ari Kim from Seoul Korea, and guitar player BenoÕåt Perraudeau, from french indie rock band Film Noir. We are friends who like to work together because we can bring in different elements to create a sort of total sensory experience. Our ambition for this project is to tell a story through songs and images, amid a mayhem of vivid projections, colored lights, crumpled vinyl architectures and noisy soundscapes, and for the performance part we want to put the audience onstage with the musicians. LIFE ON LOOP? Well, it all started when we saw this old guy walking back and forth in a swimming pool for hours on end. The video Jungwan shot of that guy was the starting point of our work. We started wondering what his story was, or what it could have been, and then elaborating visually and musically on repetition, loops, etc. WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE? Most of it is based on the interaction between flat images projected on 3-d structures.  Inside a darkened room, video images are projected on and through clear vinyl crumbled in circular (loop) pattern make up a 6ft-high 18ft-long bent wall that hangs in the center. Imagine Richard Serra_Ñés metal wall in clear but wrinkled form. The projected images are scattered through the different layers and sometimes seem to be floating in the air.  An other part uses a stainless-steel frame holding a screen made of rows of translucent strings attached horizontally. It looks like several harps attached together. Images projected onto the strings again take on 3-dimensional form. WHAT DOES IT SOUND LIKE? It_Ñés a mix of straight forward songs and experimental sound-scapes, sometimes reminiscent of Sonic Youth, the Velvet Underground or Cold War Kids. The line up is guitar, synthesizer, drum machine and vocals. WHERE & WHEN The exhibition will take place at the PYO gallery in Los Angeles from October 23 to November 28 2010.  The performance will take place on October 23rd. HOW the MONEY is USED Airfare, shipping fees, material and fabrication, equipment rental, video making, music making, etc.  This is well over $5000 but that start would get us on spot.

In longform and free form, in mixtapes and photo essays, with depth and humor, the magazine delved into the story behind sports, eschewing the simplistic narratives sports fans are too often fed. For nearly two years, Norman Einstein's Monthly was my life. I started it with just a far-flung hope that I could convince my favorite sportswriters on the internet to go crazy and make stunning work with no restrictions... and to do it all for free. In an online world hurtling rapidly toward the second-by-second update, I decided the magazine would head in the other direction and publish once a month, giving our creators the time to construct and reshape each piece, to build something truly unique. From those naive aspirations, Norman Einstein's grew from a wild experiment into a publication churning out insightful work month by month. To say it exceeded my expectations is an understatement.  Now Norman Einstein's very best is being published in one print volume... with help from you! From the roar of a football stadium to the rodeos of the American West, from a hard foul's violent beauty to a penalty shootout's ecstatic panic, from long-shot dreams in forgotten gyms to tragic blunders on the biggest stages, our very best stories go far and wide to prove that everything worthy in sports can be found at every level. The stories we tell touch the universal themes of sports: triumphant, tragic, and all points in-between. That's why we are now pulling our best work into one volume, to give tangible form to our celebration of the ineffable wonder of sports. We're not just making a book. We're making something unique. We're enshrining our words and photos in an edgy package to match the edgy ideas they contain. Norman Einstein's NORMANTHOLOGY features work by Andrew Reilly of the 35th Street Review, Alex and Ben Birdsall of There Are No Fours, Brian Blickenstaff of Touch & Tactics, Eric Nusbaum and Ted Walker of Pitchers & Poets, Fredorrarci of The Classical, Graydon Gordian of 48 Minutes of Hell, Johnny Saward of Ronald Bellamy's Underachieving All Stars, Stephanie Lim of Limpire, and yours truly, the publisher of the magazine.  We're asking you for help realizing our vision. Our goal of $2,000 reflects the cost of printing 250 copies of the Anthology and producing the rewards. If we exceed our goal, we'll print more copies. We want to get this book in as many hands as we can. Every reward level includes a copy of the book, in addition to lots of rad limited-edition swag like prints of our best photos, posters, and t-shirts with our favorite Joe Theismann quote (""Nobody in football should be called a genius. A genius is a guy like Norman Einstein."") and so much more!ë_ So support great storytelling and give to the Norman Einstein's NORMANTHOLOGY today! _ÑÓCian O'Day REWARDS:""",0,7.60090246,1,Nonfiction,2012
"The DREAMline Project was started by former Special Education Teacher, School Guidance Counselor and Activist Daniel Garcia. During his many years teaching in the New York City Department of Education and time spent in his internships in New York and San Diego, California, he realized that there are a faction of students that face disadvantages when it comes to funding their post-secondary education. Garcia is using Stoopid Smart Clothing and The DREAMline Project to help to put an end to the disadvantages that face these students. He is using his T-Shirt business to raise money for DREAMer_Ñés post-secondary education. Raising money privately is extremely important due to the fact that these students cannot receive Federal Student Aid or Federal Loans to pay for college. In many states including New York, these students cannot receive State Aid for college either. These students are referred to as DREAMers or Dream Act Students.ë_ DREAMers are students that receive a K-12 education for free, but due to issues with their immigration status cannot receive federal funding and in many states cannot receive state funding for college. We are using our business to bring awareness to this issue and to raise funds for these amazing students. Dreamers have to fund their post-secondary education via a combination of ways. The major ways of funding their education are scholarships, institutional aid and/ or private funding. Many DREAMers are unable to pay for college and due to these obstacles they do not see college or any post-secondary education as an option. The DREAMline Project and Stoopid Smart Clothing are collaborating to raise awareness and to raise funds to supplement DREAMers post-secondary education. To make this DREAM a reality Stoopid Smart Clothing and The DREAMline Project are selling T-shirt and taking donations. 100% of the proceeds from each shirt sold will go into a DREAMers Scholarship Fund. At TheDREAMline Project and at STOOPIDSMARTCLOTHING.COM we feel that it is our mission to serve others before we serve ourselves. Please help us to raise money for these students.

"Toys, what a wonderful word. Toys allow us to unleash our creativity-- whether we are children or adults. They are a portal to imaginary worlds with the ability to form friendships and connections that may be missing in our everyday lives. Every parent knows that there is something precious about a child lost in play with their favorite toys.   When I was young and I heard about ""monsters,"" I conjured up images of scary otherworldly animals that were hiding in my closet or lurking under my bed just waiting to grab me when the lights went out.ë_ That is why, as an artist, the monsters I create are not the scary beings from my childhood.  These characters are fun, playful, and quirky. I call themë_The Horndribbles!  There is Zapp, Hux, Mosby, and Meeks. They show kids that not all monsters are scary.  The Horndribbles are different, which makes them unique and special. After college, I fell in love with fabric and sewing, which allowed me to turn my drawings of the Horndribbles into actual  hand-made plush sculptures. I began exhibiting them in Denver art shows and quickly gained a dedicated following in the community. The kids and parents who attended my art shows connected with the Horndribbles, thus inspiring my passion even more.    I wanted to tell The Horndribble story to the children and parents who were drawn to them. So, I began to envision their world and created Horndribble Island,  a wilderness of endless places to explore! This led me to co-author a children_Ñés book based around my favorite characters. The first book is called: The stories are immersive and an interactive experience for kids and parents.  I want families to get lost in this fantastical world with these wonderful characters. I'd love the opportunity to continue the journey with my second book.ë_I will bring the same level of detail and artistry as I did the first book.ë_ Thank you, Kickstarter community, for allowing me to tell my story and for coming along on this adventure with me (Zapp, Hux, Mosby and Meeks!)""",0,9.159047078,1,Children's Books,2013

" (On the up side, all the donations return to the backers, and they lose nothing!) My name is Alex Campion, and I am the sole member of NOW WE ARE SIX, a band based in the Pacific Northwest. I write and perform everything you hear on the recordings (lyrics, melodies, vocals, rhythm and lead guitars, bass, synth and drums - though this last one is programmed). It is the thing I care about most in this world besides my scrumtralescant wife, and it acts as a vessel for the vortex of wonder and lunacy present within my brain. Without it, the madhouse beckons.ë_ Since I do everything on my own, I want to make it possible to perform it alone as well. In order to do this, I need a new laptop (which will also be my new composing station since my current iMac, which I must say struggles valiantly, is terribly underpowered); a few pieces of music software (logic 9 for arranging, ableton for live performance, a komplete 8 update for virtual instruments) a stage piano; an assortment of guitar pedals; new frets for my extremely worn main guitar; and a few midi controllers. In the vision I have in my mind of my live show, I sing and accompany myself, alternating between guitar and keyboard, and play various lead parts and solos using a combination of on-the-fly loops, for the continuation of rhythm parts, and triggered pre-existing mp3 samples through live performance software on my laptop. The project will be complete when I have this equipment, have practiced and honed my use of it, and am playing my first gig in Los Angeles, where my wife and I have finally taken the steps to move in the next month or so. She is a handbag designer, and we are both moving to LA to pursue our dreams with dogged determination. I can't exaggerate how I fantasize about this. It occupies my thoughts throughout the course of each day, and sometimes when I go to bed at night, I picture myself on stage, thrashing my trusty guitar and raging into the microphone. It's the only thing I have ever found that I am good at, and I am utterly determined to make it my life's purpose. In myriad ways, it already is.

"The video (seen above) is a compilation of small scenes that have been put together and action scenes that will not be used as a result of lack of props, locations, and decent audio.  The actual film webseries will be much better than it is portrayed to be by the trailer.  We are a couple teens intrigued by the film world.  We began creating action shorts in November of 2012, and they were terrible.  We quickly progressed however, in both talent and equipment.  We invite you to join us on our journey as we become better and more experienced film makers.  'The Debt' is an action thriller web series following the story of two young men with a unique set of skills who find themselves deep in debt to an underground drug smuggler.  In order to repay him, they must work full time for a drug cartel.  They quickly discover that this labor is far more violent and ruthless than they could ever imagine.  We began brainstorming for the series about a month ago. We were extremely excited about filming, so we got right into it. After recording and editing a few scenes, we soon realized we did not have the ability to purchase things essential to create some of the big action scenes that held our plot line together and just generally made our series better.  Anything you can donate -- $5, $10, $25, or even more -- will help us reach our $600 goal necessary to make this film. It's an ambitious goal, but we determine it essential in order to deliver the best, highest quality film possible.   A large portion of the money donated will go towards the purchasing of props.  Several of the big action scenes we plan for require big good looking guns that none of us possess.  We decided that airsoft guns were the best way to go.  Although they look great, airsoft guns are not cheap, and being teenagers, we don't have a lot of money lying around.  Some money will also go towards the purchasing of a equipment, including a microphone, green screens, memory cards, batteries, and other camera accessories.  Although we have some very good cameras (discussed below), we do not have a very good way to record audio.  A good 25% - 30% of your money will go towards a decent mic to record amazing audio for us.  Our current method of recording audio is the built in mics in our cameras, which pick up the sound of the cameras' motors which generally ruins the audio. Below is a spreadsheet of how the money will be spent.  Feel free to ask questions in the comment section, it will be answered within the day. A Spreadsheet Explaining (In Debth) Our Budget if the Project is Successfully Funded. We are already on our way, writing the first three episodes of The Debt and have began filming some of the minor scenes that do not require expensive costumes, props, and locations. Image from the Opening Scene of Episode 1, filmed in a closet in one of our basements. Image from the Opening Scene of Episode 1, filmed in a closet in one of our basements.  We currently have a $0 budget for this film.  We have friends and family willing to pitch in, but only if the kickstarter is successfully funded.  We are using all possible resources to create the best possible final product, but we need your help. With the money raised from our kickstarter, we will be able to make purchases necessary for making this webseries a success.  We already have a very good camera, the Canon 5D mark II.  In terms of editing, we are going to use Adobe Premiere Pro for composing clips, Adobe After Effects for adding VFX and color grading, and Adobe Photoshop for creating thumbnails and costume accessories.  We are hoping to make nine 10 - 20 minute episodes.  We have only planned for one season, but depending on how well it does, we may continue the story.  We will write, film, and edit three episodes at a time.  This means we will upload three episodes in three weeks every 2 - 4 months.  Updates will be available to backers only.  All episodes of the webseries will be uploaded to our YouTube channel about a month after the original is released.  The only way to see the episodes upon release is to purchase a reward that promises a digital download of each episode.  As for when,  the webseries (if funded) should begin releasing in early August (for the backers that purchase a digital copy), and in late August or early September they will be released to YouTube.  The address of our channel will be revealed if the project is successfully funded.  We have 12 actors that will be a part of this series.

Machined from aircraft grade aluminum and solid brass, we have achieved an unmatched level of quality and surface finish. Each gyroscope is finished by hand, leaving it with a brushed aluminium look that subtly varies from piece to piece. This finish is called Manuka Raw.  For those who prefer a more uniform look, the rest of the Manuka line will be anodized* giving them a consistent and beautiful finish. We have six colours available  including an exclusive Kickstarter Green that won't ever be available anywhere else. Every gyroscope comes with a Kevlar (super strong) pull string and ergonomic machined aluminium pull handle. This allows you to spin the gyroscope up to a really high speed which is important for some tricks. The slot in the handle allows you to neatly wrap and stow the string. We have also produced an aluminium display stand that reflects the beauty and precision of the gyroscope. The stand is an optional extra. The display stand comes with a notch in the top that allows you to perform tricks with the gyroscope.  Thanks to backer feedback, we designed the Super-Stand. The new display stand has a precision machined slot to neatly stow the pull handle and ""Made in London"" laser engraved on the base. You can also customise the colour of the stand and pull handle. To get the Super-Stand just pledge for the Showcase-Plus reward or above. Bespoke engraving is alsoë_available with the Manuka Engraved reward. The Manuka Collector reward (limited to 50 units) also includes aë_unique engraved serial number (eg. limited edition:15/50).ë_ We take huge pride in quality, and will not deliver anything but the best. We have an excellent team ready to start work if the campaign is successful. You can expect regular and honest updates from us. If there's good news we'll tell you; if we are having tough times we'll also let you know.  We really hope you back us and look forward to sending you a beautiful hand crafted gyroscope that will last a lifetime.  For those that want to know a bit more about how our gyroscope works we have made this short video **************************************************************************************************** * Anodizing is the application of a coloured oxide film coating to aluminium. This allows us to add really vivid and striking colours to the gyroscope frame. US, EU, EEA and CANADIAN SHIPPING IS INCLUDED IN ALL OUR REWARDS.

"I developed an enquiring and adventurous palate in my early teens. My first ""real"" jobë_was at Michael Anthony's Creative Cuisine, located on the cusp of the Hamptons inë_East Moriches, Long Island. Here I learned the differences between creminis andë_shiitakes and entered a parallel universe of food I was unaware of and which most ofë_my peers had no interest in. Even though I had my heart set on working in the musicë_business as soon as I was old enough to fly the coop, I knew further down, in thatë_same pulsing organ, food was in my future. I had a few scores to settle with otherë_interests before then, I just didn't know how long it would take. So I put in a goodë_decade being a mouthpiece and manager for bands, got to work with nearly all of myë_recorded heroes, then finally bowed out, or rather escaped, the music biz when the ë_rock and roll lifestyle was threatening to simply kill me. Shortly after fleeing Manhattan and moving to Red Hook, I found myself manning theë_neighborhood's nerve center, The Bait and Tackle Bar. I was able to get close with aë_chunk of the local population and being the social creature I am, gained insight as toë_what they desired and what their hopes were for the neighborhood. Food. It's been a few years since I woke up with this idea to build a restaurant- and I have been building it ever since. It hasn't been easy. As a matter of fact its been an uphill battle every step of the way but Grindhaus was JUST about there. It would have been open by now if ë_that Sandy botch hadn't appeared and gutted both myself and the fully outfitted space. But enough about that- let's just move forward.ë_ I've manage to restore the dining room, salvage the floors, replace walls and remove and reinstall all of the electrical workings to comply with post disaster remediation. That was painful considering the job had recently been completed before the flood. I ë_had the entire kitchen in place and was about to begin testing menu items when, yeah, we know what happened. Right now, Grindhaus needs to replace the entire kitchen in order to get open. Buying a spare, back up kitchen was not something ë_budgeted for! ë_This is where you can be a huge help as Grindhaus's status of not being in operation yet has cut the project out of nearly every form of emergency assistance. Ouch. Grindhaus would like to be in operation by this summer and what I'm trying to raise will absolutely cover getting fully up and running. Should it be so lucky as to raise more, the backyard will be completed for your al fresco dining pleasure until old man winter strikes again.ë_ But the food! What shall this Grindhaus serve? Ahhhh! Cast aside the notion of a complete sausage parlor, for space cannot provide. Harken back to a time, if you can, when a street-water dog was your sustenance, when a St Mark's patty of soy with viscous orange adornment equated weekend success, ë_and ALL you knew about noodles came from Italians. . . or out of a cup.

The funds gathered will determine the scope of the project. ë_I have already exhausted my limited resources and promised myself I would revisit the project once my finances allowed, but this cannot wait. ë_We face damaging scrutiny from law makers and there are now bans that have been placed on the practice in many places, and threats of bans in others. ë_ I will finish the project regardless of funding. ë_If I have to hitch hike across the country recording this on my iPhone I will, but that just wouldn't do the project justice. ë_There are major events in the coming year that will never happen again. ë_The time is now or never. ë_Without the help of the backers of Kickstarter the scope will be horribly limited. ë_ At the $2,000.00 goal I will only be able to do  of what I want included in the film. ë_I will be able to purchase a camera, lighting, and audio equipment as well as cover incidental production costs. ë_However, if I want to do all that I can to make this film perfect, then I'll need $20,000. ë_Hopefully all of these funds are raised in this Kickstarter campaign, but I will continue to raise funds as needed to complete the project by the deadline of 12/25/15, and do all I can with what I raise.

"I'm a big fan of ice hockey and my hometown St. Louis Blues.ë_Let's Go Blues!!! I've been looking for good ice hockey miniatures so I could paint them up in my team colors.ë_ I searched and searched and could notë_find anything in pewter that really matched what I was looking for...so I took it upon myself to have some made.ë_ I worked with sculptor Mike Evans (of the Dwarven Adventurers Box Set) to have four sketches and sculpts made.ë_ Mike's done his part and now I need to do mine...raise some fund to have them moulded, cast and sent out to all you backers!!! For this project, we created four poses that I thought would be pretty versatile.ë_ They are playmaker, defensemen, goalie, and sniper.ë_ It was hard narrowing it down to four poses, but I think these fit.ë_ We used pictures of real players througout the years to make these so they're all realistic.ë_ They are all 28mm scale and sculpted by the talented Mike Evans.ë_  Envisioned as possibly a center, he has his eyes up ice and is leaning slightlyë_in to his right.ë_ He had to be righted just a bit for casting purposes.ë_ I like the simplicity and balance of the pose.ë_  The biggest of the skaters, he measures 30.5mm to the eyes.ë_ë_ You can imagine him gliding up the ice as his forwards get the puck in deep. I was tempted to go with a modern, NHL goalie look, but just couldn't resist the old time goalie mask and pads.ë_ He was sculpted to be roughly 22mm to the eyes or roughly 4' to match the crossbar.ë_ ë_I think he has a groovy 60's feel. This pose displays the shooter as he's just let loose of a wicked slapper!ë_ He's leaning slightly to his right and all his weight is in the left foot.ë_  James Wappel is an amazing painter.ë_ Seeing his work in person is always a treat.ë_ James put his talents to these pewter figurines to help show the details of what they can look like painted.ë_ You can follow his work on them on his blog at  The miniatures are delivered as unpainted white metal.ë_  ë_ For the miniature team sets (Power Forward & Sniper level), if you'd prefer to get two snipers and one playmaker instead, we can do that.ë_ The net will be made in polished white 3-D printed plastic. You can add as many nets as you want to any backer level for $8 for each net as of now (ie you don't have to wait for Stretch Goal #1). The net is 35.4mm wide x        18.7mm deep x        20.3mm high (1.4"" w x        0.7"" d x        0.8"" h).ë_ ë_ There are currently no stretch rewards planned.ë_ We may consider doing additional ice hockey miniatures in the future based upon the success of this campaign. Forceball is our card game based on hockey.  It is fast paced, easy to learn and was rated by Drake's Flames as a game that there no good reason not to buy (  ë_).  Take turn bidding points for moves during the game until you win a hand and get to perform the move that won the bid from gaining power to your shots, gaining more cards to your hands for more strategic options or scoring a goal. We also once upon a time thought we were doing a futurist hockey game but it fell through and we still have the miniatures from our start of that project that if you would like you can pick up as well.

"In 1729, the infamous Irish author, Jonathan Swift, writes his satirical pamphlet 'A Modest Proposal,' criticizing British rule in Ireland. Swift suggests to impoverished Irish mothers to sell their babies to the rich as food. To Swift's disbelief, this suggestion is taken literally by a group of aristocrats, which transforms them into mindless flesh-eating zombies. Now, Jonathan Swift must expel the zombies and the British from Ireland before it's consumed whole. This Kickstarter project is to help fund the first 32 pages (1st act) of the graphic novel adaptation of Jonathan Swift's classic satire turned on its head. This is a story I've been working on for almost a year and now I'm enlisting the help of artist, Felle Jones  , to bring it to life...or death. This unique period piece combines the wit of Jonathan Swift with frilly wigged zombies for a dramatic yet darkly comedic commentary on both 18th century and modern imperialism.  The funds raised from this KickStarter project will be put towards paying the artist, printing and shipping costs, and kickstarter/credit card fees needed to complete the project. The goal is to fund this compelling story and kick start the completion of the entire graphic novel, plus any future adaptations to the screen (fingers crossed).

My grandfather immigrated to the US from Scotland. Scotland is in danger of losing the Gaelic language, and many people worldwide are trying to help revive it.  I am working with a talented crew on a local film shoot, as part of a wider international film project, based in Scotland.  Our film crew in Virginia will gather footage of people in our area who are passionate about Gaelic and Scottish culture.  This footage will go to a new effort in Scotland called  , which is designed to connect the Gaelic diaspora around the world.  is run by Scottish composer and music producer  , along with his talented team of some of Scotland_Ñés top cultural figures.  We feel the diaspora has a dynamic role to play in keeping Gaelic language and culture vibrant.  Our film shoot will help give Scottish policy makers and Gaelic advocates a clearer picture of what kinds of people make up the diaspora in Virginia, and help further outreach and new connections.

Please note that our final product is meant for submission to another product; this means we are giving the  team a wealth of footage from which they will pick their favorite scenes.ë_ Their overall product is also short (3-4 minutes) and will comprise our scenes, along with contributions from others all around the world. Regardless of what  uses for its final film product, we will share our footage with our contributors, so that they can see the end result which we submit to Jim Sutherland and the  team. As a bonus, our first project will give us ample leftover footage which we hope to use to start a second film shoot.ë_ It also gives us a good amount of video with audio.ë_ While this will go largely unused for the  video, including interviews and other audio will be very useful to our short film, which will be more substantive.ë_ Our film will look more closely at the people in the Scottish diaspora in Virginia, following subjects to events like Gaelic classes, traditional music events, cultural ceremonies like Hogmanay celebrations, and so forth.ë_ The goal will be to show Scotland how Scottish culture is alive in Virginia, with many people taking part in traditions and eager to forge connections with modern Scotland. This budget of $375 pays for the completed product of our first film shoot, which will be a collection of scenes submitted to a larger film project in Scotland. This includes roughly 3-4 hours in the field, shooting on a Canon 5D, which will yield roughly an hour or more of footage.ë_ This budgets also pays for professional film editing, during which my editor and I will work together to condense our footage into a 5-7 minute final package, to send to the   team in Scotland.ë_ This amount also goes toward production assistance on-site, along with our KickStarter fees and any incidental expenses.ë_ This budget also helps cover any expenses for our promotional video, which uses the services of a separate film editor, the professional photography of two Scottish photographers, music, and release forms.ë_ Many of our collaborators are offering their services either for free or highly-reduced rates in support of Gaelic.

But sometimes a little extra help is needed, and that's when our interactive tutor figures out what's going on and gives a nudge in the right direction. *, rather than a high-level module with magical stuff inside.

There are a bunch of awesome features we were planning to work on after we ship out the rewards, but with your help, we can start on them right away! We'd love to integrate LightUp_Ñés programmable Arduino block with a visual programming environment! Kids can then start programming with an intuitive drag and drop interface, and not worry about syntax until they understand more about programming concepts. We_Ñéve already begun discussing how to do this with a couple of the most popular visual programming environments for Arduino. We eventually want kids to learn about schematics and simulation, the same stuff used by makers and engineers. With your help, we_Ñéll be able to connect the LightUp App to a web based circuit simulator! Now kids can understand the language of engineering (schematics) while interacting with LightUp. We_Ñéve already talked to the makers of a couple of the most popular web simulators to get this going.  We can hire an intern to work on LightUp Hub, an online sharing platform for projects and lessons which will eventually connect to the LightUp App. The class projects that inspired LightUp were started in Professor Blikstein's   at the Stanford Graduate School of Education. The ideas behind LightUp are based on years of educational research. We've taken LightUp to kids, parents and teachers many times and improved our design based on their feedback. We've even conducted formal controlled studies with LightUp to measure its effectiveness as a teaching tool. As we develop LightUp further we will continue to work very closely with the TLT Lab and Professor Blikstein. Over the past year, we've tested prototypes of LightUp at events like Hack the Future, Stanford SPLASH, and the Shenzhen Mini Maker Faire. We've also talked to teachers at local schools about introducing LightUp in their engineering electives. We've gone through the hardware startup accelerator,  , and developed partnerships with manufacturers to produce LightUp. ë_With funding from Kickstarter, we can invest in tooling to make the first LightUp kits. The blocks require tooling to injection mold the plastic base and deep draw the metal connector caps on the ends of the blocks. We've already found the factories that can produce our parts and contract manufacturers willing to work with us. ë_ ë_| ë_  We want to make LightUp asë_accessibleë_as possible. That's why we will release the circuit board designs and the core of the LightUp App. We're also doing our best to keep the boards visible and easy to understand.

"It's a comic book, for one thing.ë_ And it's a little bit bipolar. On one hand you've got Earth, with gas masks, physics, Oregon, PTSD, a metaphorical monster, ghosts, the future, a cat, and absolutely no people aside from Felix. Then you've got Litheii, with chariot racing, a third-world community,ë_Meso-American tribal influence, religion, cannibalistic neanderthals, and a girl named Shrift. If you add those up, you've got one very unique sci-fi romance.ë_ The story behind 13 Light-Years Away has developed gradually over the course of several years. If you were to ask me where it came from, the simplest answer to that question would be, ""it came from me.""  To be a little more specific, 13 Light-Years Away is a direct product of my life as Rachel Everett. It is the combination of all of my aesthetic fascinations, as well as my philosophies and perspectives I have developed throughout my short 19-year-long existence. What started out as an attempt at creating a really cool-looking and creative story soon evolved into the force that drives me to improve as a person, a storyteller, and an artist.ë_ But it has also become something much, much deeper; 13 Light-Years Away is my personal message of hope to the world.  If you'd like to know what that is, you'll just have to read the comic. (Which won't happen for a very long time, unless this project is funded) ;) ""Chapter 0"" can be compared to a trailer to a TV series. It's much shorter than a regular comic book (only about 16 pages) and it brushes over a lot of detail in the same way a trailer would. It's a little taste of what is to come.  I'm starting 13LYA off this way because I want to make people excited for it. It's a little bit of a teaser, with the intent to lure in an audience before the production of the actual series. Basically it's a marketing technique. It's also a way for me to get my feet wet in the comic industry before I dive in head-first with my baby project.  Ever since I could hold a pencil, I've been making art and telling stories. It's always been my dream to apply both of these passions to a career. ""13 Light-Years Away: Chapter 0"" is my first official step toward accomplishing that dream.ë_ By contributing to the production of Chapter 0, you are essentially taking a seed that has been developing for a very long time, anxiously awaiting the opportunity to grow, and planting it in the ground.ë_ I just want to print this comic already and get it into your hands! But printing comics costs a whole lot of money. By giving me the money that I don't have, you are literally giving 13LYA a kickstart. You're helping me to express myself as an artist, and you're opening the door to discovering an entirely new world and a story that just might change your life.ë_""",0,7.313220387,1,Graphic Novels,2015
"In the 1960s and 1970s Tito's Yugoslavia saw a flowering of popular Roma gypsy music. Reinvigorating their folk traditions with the Indian, Turkish, British and American sounds that poured from their radios, the Roma were given a platform and a voice which they had never enjoyed before and have long since lost. Sometimes lively and rhythmic, sometimes mournful, the Roma pop songs of the 1960s and 1970s were cosmopolitan, sophisticated and brilliantly executed, and still sound amazingly fresh today. However, despite their immense importance and popularity at the time, the songs of this musical golden age are in now danger of being forgotten. For the past year we have been on a quest to recover this incredible music, and now, with the help of Kickstarter, we hope to release a beautifully designed compilation showcasing the scene's key tracks. More than just a record, this will be a vital cultural document with extensive liner notes, rare photographs and lovingly restored audio fidelity.

Soon, I began to fill my neighborhood with the sweet aroma of fresh, home-roasted coffee. I was happy_Ñ_and so were the neighbors. Our friends and neighbors enjoyed my coffee as we gathered, talked and played games.ë_They came in as acquaintances, neighbors, even strangers_Ñ_but they always left as friends.ë_ In 2007, we moved to Michigan. In October 2009, Chazzano Coffee Roasters and Cafe opened in Ferndale. Michigan. From the beginning, we knew that Chazzano was about more than just great coffee. ë_Chazzano has become a meeting place...not just a place to meet your friends, but a place to meet new friends. ë_The beauty of an incredible cup of coffee is shared by people from all walks of life and, through the coffee, connections are made.ë_ What makes our coffee so spectacular is the freshness. ë_Two and a half weeks after the date it is roasted, we donate our coffee to homeless shelters and community organizations. ë_Our coffee grounds go to local community gardens that help the residents of Detroit. Over the last two and a half years, Chazzano has grown rapidly. ë_In addition to our retail customers, we have gone from just 3 wholesale accounts in 2009 to over 110 today. ë_Restaurants, specialty stores and offices are now serving our coffee. Their customers and clients appreciate that the coffee that they drink is as special as the food that they have enjoyed. ë_We ship our coffee to customers all over the United States. With your help, Chazzano can continue to grow. ë_We plan to use this money to buy green, unroasted coffee beans from around the world. We buy our coffee in 132-150 pound bags from farms in countries like Ethiopia, Mexico, Nicaragua and Sumatra. ë_All of our beans are fair trade and organic. ë_Often, our beans come from small farms that, through our purchases, are able to keep their businesses growing. ë_One of the lots we bought last year was from a cooperative run solely by women-Nicaragua Las Nubes. ë_Being able to help small farmers is one of the great joys of being a specialty coffee roaster. ë_""",1,9.210340372,0,Food,2012

"Your donation to the production of the play BILL W. AND DR. BOBë_is 100% tax deductible and will go to Hazelden Foundation, a non-profit organization whose mission is to restore hope, healing, and health to people affected by addiction to alcohol and other drugs.  Hazelden is proud to be the play's main sponsor and producer. (This project does not imply any affiliation or endorsement by AA World Services.)   Because there are no investors to pay back, once the play opens we envision that the theatre production will pay for itself, and run and run so that it becomes an icon in New York, attracting not only the general theatre audience but also 12-step members from all over the world.ë_ All revenues go back to Hazelden to fund scholarships for treatment and also for a national non-profit tour of college campuses to deal with the epidemic of binge drinking on campus--which kills 2000 students per year (5 per day).    Our total production budget  is $450,000 and we are so close now!   The money we raise on Kickstarter will go to finishing off the remaining funding to reach our goal.   If we raise $20,000 on KickStarter, we will be able to give the ""green light"" to the production team in New York, sign the contract with our general manager and  director and plan casting, publicity, outreach--and start to move  toward opening Off Broadway in May 2013. If we raise more than $20,000, it will help the play production greatly:  we will add staff with liaisons to the AA community for publicity and marketing and outreach, purchase more advertising, and manage the roll-out of the service-activity when the play opens. ""Service-activity"" includes nights dedicated to one or the other 12-step groups, nights for treatment centers, and therapists and counselors, outreach to all the medical schools in New York, and more.  In 1929, famous New York stockbroker Bill Wilson crashes with theë_stock market and becomes a hopeless drunk. Dr. Bob Smith, a surgeonë_from Ohio, has also been an alcoholic for thirty years, often going into the operating room with a hangover. Through an astonishing series of events, Bill W. and Dr. Bob meet and form a relationship, each helping to keep the other sober. This is the amazing and often humorous story of the two men who pioneered Alcoholics Anonymous, as well as the story of their wives, the two women who founded Al Anon.  Learn More @ Since it's award-winning, for-profit run Off Broadway in 2007, BILL W. AND DR. BOB has been produced in 35 states, to great reviews and sold-out houses. ë_ The play almost always breaks box office records, because it attracts not only the usual theatre audience but also members of Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12-step programs, their families and friends. The play is known throughout the 12-step community all over the country_ÑÓthe ""buzz'_Ñù is out for its return to New York. BILL W. AND DR.

"The vision for  is a full-color, 7.5"" x 9.25"" book created in real-time over the final 30 days (the month of April) before the residents of the squatter community face a forcible eviction.ë_ I will document and tell a story that not only captures the honest struggles and difficulties of life within a squatter community in the Philippines, but I will bring to light their simpler and, arguably, more graceful manner of living. I will share the common smiles on their faces and the laughter in their voices. Not only will I introduce these beautiful, warm individuals to you, but I will also document their final 30 days at the place they have called ""home"" for decades. ë_ ë_ë_ This place--their home--is located in the heart of the financial district in metro Manila and is surrounded by towering office buildings and shiny, forty-floor condominiums. Imagine the financial district of New York City's lower Manhattan; now place a decade's-old squatter community right in the center of Wall Street. That imaginary scenario is a real-life equivalent for the Tin Roof Community. Their eviction will be followed by an immediate demolition of their homes ... followed by the erection of more office buildings and condominiums.ë_ Once funded, I will--each day during the month of April--interview, talk with, photograph, record and document the every day life within what I lovingly refer to as The Tin Roof Community. I am already known within and welcomed by the community; access will be no problem.ë_ There is a great sense of urgency regarding this project. I only recently learned of this upcoming forced eviction and demolition and, in order to be fully prepared to start this project the first of April, I find myself facing an unfortunate time crunch: together we must reach the goal within the next 7 days.ë_ Although these families and individuals live meager life-styles--many with only dirt for floors, no running water, holes in the walls without glass where windows should be, most without electricity, they work long days for 100PHP ($2.50), food is scarce--THEY ARE HAPPY. And it is exactly that reflexive natural ability to live each day happily that I wish to highlight.ë_ There is a spirit at the Tin Roof Community that is uplifting, contagious. ë_This is a place that needs to be remembered. This is a place that fosters friendship, family and togetherness.ë_Although they fight bureaucracy, drug dealers, poverty and hunger, their happy spirit persists. This is a community that fights, celebrates, cries, laughs, mourns and plays together. They sleep together in the same room on a wood floor, they sleep with legs crossed over one another, they wash together, they cook together, they eat together--everything they do, they do together, and they do it with a beautiful humility.ë_ Their story is simply a human interest story that demands to be shared.ë_ The objective of this project is to not only document the final days as a remembrance for the community, but to put a beautiful, high-quality book in your hands to share their stories, to share their lives. The wonderful thing about book publishing is that they enjoy tremendous economies of scale.ë_ So here's the opportunity: as more people reserve books, the quality of each backer's book increases: a bigger print run means everything is cheaper.ë_ The more people who back at the $50+ or higher category, the higher the quality of each book (created by the finest off-set printing and digital on-demand book printing service in the nation). The exterior of the reward book will most definitely be of a highest-of-quality, perfect bound, full-color, matte-finished trade paperback. The interior will also be in full-color on white paper. It will be 7.5"" x 9.25"". , with enough backers, this book will be produced as above, but rather with a casebound linen hardcover exterior and a 100# satin paper interior.ë_ The entire process is going to be uplifting and rewarding. Any amount of support gets you behind-the-scenes access, and I'm going to share ideas, photographs, observations, experiences and answer questions as I go. I'm aiming for 150-200 pages. My targeted deadline for the finished and edited text is May 31, 2014. I will then immediately get the book printed, hopefully beating my estimated shipping date by a few weeks if not an entire month.""",1,8.779557456,1,Nonfiction,2014

"""After years of new diets, scientific advancements, and self-medicated citizens, the medical world has found itself monopolized by the corporate giant Garrison Pharmaceuticals. ë_Their new line of products have pushed the limits of human enhancement through medication, and is under constant attack by morality activists, claiming that a line has been crossed and G.P. is playing God."" This series takes place in the near future in an almost utopia-like society where medication rules all. The new pills are expensive but allow for some amazing human enhancement and abilities. The first episode focuses on the pill system Memerase, a series of pills that will target and destroy any unwanted memories or thoughts. This sounds perfect to an artist who finds herself hitting a mental block just weeks before her new gallery show, and needs to complete one final painting. Her manager turns to Memerase, and all hell breaks loose... Each episode will have a new main character storyline for the episode, and a new medication, each season will have a mini-story, and each season feeds into a main story about the mysterious man behind the dark corporation G.P. We've had 2/2 successful campaigns to raise funds, check out our other projects here: A short film: ""Scarred""  A short film: ""I Think My Mom's Trying to Kill Me""  We actually want to raise $20,000 but what we NEED to raise is $10,000 to get the look we want for this series, and that means myself and most of the actors will be unpaid. Of course, if we can hit our real goal of $20,000 we can get the name talent who's interested in this project and feed into an even higher production value. If you're unfamiliar with the filming process, just know that money goes very quickly during production. For one day, for example, we may need $850 to rent a location, $75 per crew member for the day ($750 total), $120 to feed the cast and crew lunch and pay for waters/snacks during filming, and that doesn't even include small but multiple things like wardrobe, props, lights, special effects, etc. We're thinking this will take about a week to film. Exact daily budgets will be calculated once we have a final amount raised, and the one-sheets will be available to our executive producers if requested.""",0,9.210340372,0,Film & Video,2013

"What started as an off-handed remark to my niece over tacos in Malibu has led to the greatest cinematic endeavor involving service dogs in the history of everything.  How did this happen?  When I taught writing short scripts at USC, I would tell my students to keep your cast size small, use one or two locations, and avoid anything ridiculous like big ass science laboratories, huge mountain hiking ranges, or multiple trick dogs.  I'm happy to report I forgot everything I knew about writing a short film for just enough time to write the most original story of my life.  I must thank everyone who supported the original Kickstarter for DOG BOWL. Your response was an unexpected notice from the universe to devise the best movie I was capable of, and I honored your direction with the patience, taste and thoughtfulness you displayed in your generosity. Thank you.   DOG BOWL was shot in early January 2014 in locations across Los Angeles with eighteen actors (including four dogs) over three long days and nights.  Led by our Director of Photography Kris Kachikis, our production team responded to the unique and elaborate demands of the screenplay I wrote with the highest level of professional expertise.  Our actors, featuring our beloved and tireless Marci Miller, were diligently cast from thousands of submissions and delivered performances that matched our crew's excellence shot for shot.  Now we need your help with the expenses of our shoot, as well as our post-production, including editing, sound, music, delivery and distribution. It's time to finish this beautiful story and share this special movie with audiences around the world.

"Synopsis: Õ¢ëÑëÒThe Next Big PreacherÕ¢ëÑëù fills the void that people everywhere experience, when they see men and women of God use the name of God to become rich and famous for their own self-gain and not use their platform to spread the Õ¢ëÑëÒgood newsÕ¢ëÑëù of hope, faith and healing for generations to come, while setting an example for others to follow. They will see first hand that preachers arenÕ¢ëÑëét made, they are called, they still need training and consistent support, not withÕ_ë_persistent criticism, condemnation due to lack of understanding and vision. The aspiring preachers will commit and devote their lives to full-time ministry, and vie for the approval of senior elders and ministers, who will anoint and declare the one who perseveres to the end of the series to emerge as Õ¢ëÑëÒThe Next Big Preacher.Õ¢ëÑëù Value: (For the life of this show, I plan to be 100% involved in the production. This is my passion and my calling as a Servant of God: to train disciples for Christ, and impact His world for good.) No need to look for a show runner! I am a Pastoral Counselor/Chaplain/Life Coach; my services will be used and will be proven to be most valuable. Other notable preachers will also be contacted for mentorship, and shepherding throughout the stages of development, which will also bring light to the huge problems occurring because of the lack of unity among the evangelical preachers. The youth live what they learn. LetÕ¢ëÑëés teach well and set better examples! Contrary to other one-hour long episodic installments involving preachers, this show will be focused on training preachers more so than simply following their lives.Õ_ë_ Õ_ë_The showÕ¢ëÑëés first season will span twelve weeks (or allowed by theÕ_ë_network), and after an extensive interview process twelve preachers in training will be selected and trained but only one Preacher will be ordained, and supported based on the following twelve objectives: 1.	Each participant must be subjected to an interview process for one simple reason, they MUST BE CALLED to preach! 2.	Training will be based on sound biblical doctrine to cover the following categories: the Trinity (Father, Son, & Holy Spirit), Leadership, Finances, Discipleship, Spiritual Gifts, the Administration of Gifts, Salvation, Marriage/Sex/Incest, Sin, Parenting, Death, Resurrection/Afterlife. 3.	Each participant will receive extensive Life Coaching (by this qualified author), or one of their choosing, as well as an internship with a reputable pastor/preacher/Mentor, e.g. Creflo Dollar, T.D. Jakes, Joyce Meyer, Joel Osteen, Donnie McClurkin, Kirk Franklin, Warren Campbell, Mary Mary, Industry Executives, and Reps, OR (local Preachers in their towns willing to be on camera). ***The message here is: Õ¢ëÑëÒThe Next Big Preacher,Õ¢ëÑëù does not have to preach from a pulpit, but as long as their ministry reaches lost souls who will receive healing and hope for their lives*** 4.	Community outreach- e.g. food drives, volunteering, feeding the homeless, public speaking (at schools, marches, rallies, funerals, weddings, and pastoral counseling). [Some may opt to work with reality tv shows stars they know who are not that well known, past and present] Lesson: Get out and ask, connect, or network, for a worthy and necessary cause or movement.Õ_ë_ 5.	Non-Profit Management- concept, and funding means via Kick Starter, Gofundme, crowd funding sources, donations, grants, etc. to launch their charities. The contestants will work diligently to raise money for their causes. Whatever money they raise, their mentors (pastors) can match. The Prize money (to start their ministry or life work) will come from their efforts, support of their sponsors, and the network can match the earnings based on the ratings. This is a win, win situation for all! Õ_ë_ 6.	Missionary work- Travel if desired to any state or territory of the U.S. 7.	Participants will reside in a common location to foster unity and also serve as a test of the wills. They will also be required to pass weekly challenges, which involves custodian care, networking, fundraising, speaking engagements etc. 8.	Sermon preparation and delivery upon request (There will be teaching and help with this matter). 9.

"Poorboy Candy was founded by life-long friends Kevin Halgrimson and Mike LaPoint in February 2012.ë_ We make small-batch artisan caramels.ë_ Our passion and goal is to produce the finest caramels available today.ë_ We produce everything by hand, using high-quality ingredients, and we thoroughly test and experiment to achieve the best flavors.ë_ Through hard work and dedication, we believe we've achieved our goal.ë_ After tasting our caramels, we hope you feel the same. The next phase for us is to move to a commercial kitchen of our own.ë_ Currently we are occupying a tiny corner in a pizza restaurant. We were very fortunate that our friend Tom Hanson had a little extra space he could spare in his Jimmy's Pizza restaurant in Becker, MN ë_ Sharing the kitchen has actually been great, but it does have a few issues. The biggest issues are location, size and hours.ë_ Our current kitchen is over 90 miles away from Kevin's home which means over 3 hours driving round trip as well as spending a tremendous amount of money each month on gas.ë_ Secondly, as we are operating in a very small and borrowed space we really can't add any more equipment than we currently have.ë_ And lastly, we can only do production in the hours that Jimmy's is closed for business which offers us a very limited window each day to get our work done.ë_ Our hope is to open a kitchen space large enough to accommodate our current work flow and be able to handle some additional equipment as our needs grow. Since our business opened in mid February we have had some great things happen.ë_ Our sales off of the website have been strong and our products are currently available in 14 different locationsë_ We've received great reviews from the Star Tribune, The Heavy Table, and Delightful Bites. We even haveë_ food celebrity Andrew Zimmern endorsing our caramels on OpenSky!ë_ Most recently, we were selected to be a featured product in the gift bags at the 2012 Daytime Emmy Awards. All of these things are great, and display just how far we've come in the past in the past four months.ë_ The problem is that with our current location and equipment we are just about maxed out in our ability to produce and sell our products.ë_ We simply cannot make enough caramel in our current situation to afford a new kitchen and upgraded equipment.ë_ Sadly, we've actually had to turn away business because of these issues. This is where you come in.ë_ In order to lease, build out and equip our new kitchen, we need a bit of help from our Poorboy family.ë_ That's you!ë_ Please take the time to look over our rewards for pledges.ë_ We think you might be able to find something that might peek your interest.ë_ Of course every level of pledge will earn our sincerest gratitude, but the more you pledge the better the reward.ë_ The great thing about Kickstarter is that it is truly community based assistance.ë_ Every little bit helps even if it is simply helping us with spreading the word.ë_ Kickstarter is all or nothing which means if we can not raise our goal within our time frame we will get nothing.ë_ You will not be charged for your pledge unless we reach our goal and untilë_after the project ends. Great question.ë_ We have a large list of needs for our business.ë_ Many of which are not even included in our goal.ë_ We have specifically not included most of the production equipment we are looking for because the cost to acquire these items is more than we feel comfortable asking all of our supporters to assist with.ë_ We plan on a combination of financing programs to acquire those larger items. We are currently searching for space with ample room for our current needs and some room for future expansion. After we get the space roughed in, we will need some NSF approved equipment to line the walls.ë_ We need to have a 3 compartment sink, stainless processing tables, dry storage racking, refrigeration, a vent hood, batch cooker, packaging equipment and other miscellaneous equipment in order to pass our inspection. All of the money pledged will go toward helping us acquire the space and equipment we need to meet our growing demand and streamline our production process. Thank you in advance for your support!

After ten years in the making and a brilliant premiere at The Mint in Los Angeles, Victor has geared up for a musical re-imagining unlike anything experienced before of one of the most emblematic pieces in music history, Stravinsky_Ñés Rite of Spring Hello friends and fans! I am finally ready to record Igor Stravinsky_Ñés Rite of Spring as many people think it was meant to be heard. This notable recording will include Stravinsky's Suite Italienne. I have been performing this program for the last 6 months with consistently overwhelming response and repeated shouts for more.  My dream is to bring this experience to the public by recording in a top professional studio, intelligently and aggressively marketing and then internationally releasing the recording as a way of triggering touring and concert opportunities to let people know just how vital and relevant classical music still is in the 21st century. Now that I am ready to share my artistic innovation with the world, I need your help.  I have an aggressive funding goal and great hope and confidence in these challenging times that my friends and fans will help, each as they are able, to see my dream come true.

The motors are 8.5 inches apart and the propellers are 4 inches in diameter. This model has a flight duration of 5 minutes and weighs 8.2 ounces. It has a carrying capacity of less than 3 ounces.  My second build is quite a bit larger; it spans 21 inches between motor centers and has 11 inch propellers. It was built with a Turnigy Talon V2.0 carbon fiber frame, KK2.0 flight controller, and Turnigy Multistar brushless motors. The flight duration is estimated to be 12 minutes. This craft weighs 3.7 lbs and has a carrying capacity of 2 lbs. Unfortunately this model_Ñés electronics are too simple for aerial photography.   My third quadcopter was a ready-to-fly DJI Phantom Quadcopter retrofitted by DSLRPros specifically for aerial photography.

And guess what! You get this load of awesome music pressed on a beautiful record. Mmmmmm_Ñ_ Look at it. So fresh.. No problem guy. This is being released as digital download as well as a vinyl record.

Warp marker .asd files are included to make life easy for all the DJ's out there. Care, hard work and general awesomeness has been put in by everyone involved at every stage of production and design to bring you a beautiful, beautiful thing to aggravate your neighbours with and scare the shit out of candy ravers. Destroy Oh Boy is a collaborative label. All our releases are built on the concept that collaboration between awesome people makes awesome things. And for our first release we need your collaboration. We have decided to try out a new way of releasing records. The traditional way of releasing records, where a label presses an amount of product while having no idea how much will sell, sends it to various distributors who then have to warehouse the product (these steps increase costs dramatically) while the money from the release takes months to return to the label (meaning they cannot release a new record for a long time) seemed inefficient and outdated. Destroy Oh Boy has decided to try out this new model of releasing records. It allows us to press exactly what is needed, ship our product to the buyer quickly, pay the artists and move on to our next release almost instantly. We will be committed to bringing out high quality records as quickly as we can and hopefully cutting costs dramatically so you get cheaper records as we get the distribution side more locked in. Will this work? I have no idea. But we need your support to make it work.

"Munsters Mush is a village deep in the forest that inhabits a large group of monsters of all shapes and sizes. Some young and playful, others old and grumpy. Yellow monsters and blue monsters, not one the same. Here is where the story begins.. Mr.Munster, the founder of Munsters Mush; made the forest his home with his friends and family many, many decades ago. There were all kinds of dangers that lurked outside of the village that they had built, so Mr.Munster guarded his family and friends by surrounding their village with magical mushrooms to ward off evil. Lylthum and Rhynkin (the two children monster characters in the book) are playing around the edge of the village one day when Lylthum stumbles, in front of her sits a magic mushroom named Mak.ë_ Mak tells Lylthum and Rhynkin of a devious plan Mr.Munster has for the village and not to trust him. Mr.Munster comes from the village with a large raw. In the heat of the moment they run in to the forest, leaving the village behind to find a magical center with Mak.

Funding will cover costs of printing, shipping and an ISBN barcode as well as reward costs.ë_ The book will be consistently colourful and creative the whole way through with an interactive section towards the back. The whole book will be illustrated in Adobe Illustrator using vector images for the highest quality possible. Above is the illustration style I will be using consistently throughout the process. This is just one layout, I will be posting more as the Kickstarter project goes on.ë_ Here are a few close ups so you can take a look at the details and the colours that are expressed in this simplified illustration process.ë_ ë_I hope you guys can see as much potential in this book as I do. When this project gets the funding it needs I will use any profits left over to create a sequel of the finished book.

"Hi! My name is Bob Pendarvis and 20 years ago I was asked to create and teach the first comic book illustration classes at the Savannah College of art & Design. They were so successful that I was asked to develop comics-based BFA and MFA degree programs. ë_At Atlanta's Dragon Con, I recruited artist Bo Hampton and writer Mark Kneece to help me found this new major, which I decided to call Sequential Art (as a tribute to the legendary Will Eisner). During the 18+ years I worked at SCAD, my focus was to concentrate on storytelling, allowing students to write and draw stories using their own unique approaches and styles. I was especially dedicated to making sure my classes were asë_female-friendly as possible. My new graphic novel, A GIRL CALLED ANA TEACHES KITTENS HOW TO DRAW, is meant to provide inspiration for the next generation of young sequential artists and storytellers. It is the first in a series of books aimed especially at young girls, but hopefully entertaining for readers of all ages, girls or boys. Each 8.5"" x 11"", hardcover, full color book has over 200 pages and tells the story of how ANA helps kittens realize that communicating with art is simpler than they'd suspected, yet much more complicated than they'd ever imagined. The goal of my kickstarter project is to be able to produce a high quality, full color hardcover book and send copies to potential publishers and schoolë_libraries. My ultimate goal would be to develop the ANA books into an animated tv series. I asked some of my friends and former students to help me out by donating rewards for my kickstarter project, including my fellow ""founding father"",ë_ ,   (NECA),   (LEGENDS OF THE DARK CRYSTAL),   (SHADOWEYES),   (SONIC THE HEDGEHOG),   (THE GUILD),   (GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY),ë_  (SEA PRINCESS AZURI),   (TOMB RAIDER),   (GI JOE),   (POWER LUNCH),   (RETURN TO LABYRINTH),   (ARCHER),   (MEGA MAN),  (BIOWARE),   (LEGION OF SUPERHEROES),   (THE INCREDIBLES),   (KONAMI),   (DAMN HIPSTERS),  (SUPERMARKET),ë_  (EVIL DIVA),   (LEAPFROG),   (THE VENTURE BROS.),   (NEONOMICON),   (SHOJO WONDER MANGA ART SCHOOL: CREATE YOUR OWN COOL CHARACTERS AND COSTUMES WITH MARKERS),   (DUSTY STAR), and   (ARCHER).  Their diversity reinforces my basic belief that studying the different disciplines involved with producing sequential art can lead to a wide array of opportunities, including writing and illustrating comic books, designing characters and storyboarding for animated cartoons and video games, creating children's picture books, designing toys and action figures, and more. Before I taught at SCAD, Ië_used to teach k-5 art classes in the public school system. I learned that too many promising young artists would give up learning how to draw, thanks mostly to non-constructive comments and attitudes displayed by both their fellow students and even some teachers. And schools everywhere continue cutting budgets for art and music programs, wrongly thinking that art is primarily a recreational activity and far from necessary. I strongly disagree and feel that a solid grasp of the fundamentals of sequential art would enhance and support their studies in other areas. A GIRL CALLED ANA TEACHES KITTENS TO DRAW isë_a sweet little story, but its message is vitally important. Your generous donation to my kickstarter project will help me spread that message not just to kids, but their schools and parents, too.""",0,9.61580548,0,Comics,2011

"iSights is a mobile application for both iOS and Android, especially designed for people who would like to enjoy their mobile device without the use of glasses.  Most vision problems occur when the eye cannot focus the image onto the retina. Eyeglass lenses change the direction of light entering the eyes so that it focuses properly on a special part of the back of the eye known as the retina. A vision defect is a mismatch between the eye's focal distance; the range in which the eye can actuallyë_bring an image into focus - and the distance of the object the eye is trying to focus on. iSights will work similarly for the user; manipulating the pixels on screen to emulate the effect of glasses; redirecting the light from the screen into the retina, effectively enabling you to use your mobile device without the use of vision correcting lenses. This will work with anything being displayed on your mobile device; reading, writing, movies, gaming, anything your heart desires. You are the optometrist ! just like an eye exam, you would simply scroll through preset slides to find your ë_""Prescription"" and the application will save your preferences - Presto ! You are all set to enjoy the content on your mobile device.

" In addition to the  {DOCK}, the  {DOCK}-  for Apple and Samsung   phones is now available (image available below).   Every ONE{DOCK} comes with a charge cable of your choice (Apple 30 pin or micro-USB for Samsung cell phones) and a USB wall plug to suit your region (US / UK / Australia).ë_ The cable and wall charger are black. Cell phone docks are typically made of plastic, suit one type of cell phone and have fixed levels of functionality.ë_ My goal is to create a dock that is machined from solid aluminium (to ensure a high quality look and feel)ë_butë_can be configured to suit your cell phone model and the level of functionality that is meaningful to you.ë_ The way I have been able to achieve this is by creating a solid metal base unit which can retain one of a number of custom plastic inserts (provided)ë_specifically designed to hold a range of cell phone connector cables.ë_ For example, the   can be configured to provideë_charge to yourë_iPhoneë_or Samsung Galaxy, alternatively if youë_desire a high qualityë_audio or HD video-outë_connection (both with integrated charge) then this can be achieved by combining the base unit with the desired cable.ë_ë_1 base unit, configurable to the level of functionality that you desire for your Apple or Samsung cell phone.ë_ë_ The other main advantageë_of this innovative idea is the 'future proof' nature of the design.ë_ The   will accommodate Apple's standard 30 pin connector cable, as well as their 30 pin AV cable and the new   connector (including Lightning-to-HDMI).ë_ So if you have an iPhone 4S but will be upgrading to an iPhone 5, then this is the dock for you. As touched upon above, every  ë_will beë_precision machined from aluminium.ë_ The aluminium is then bead-blast (a process used by Apple to create a smooth, consistent surface finish).ë_ To harden the aluminium, a process called 'anodizing'ë_will beë_performed (this process can also be used to change the colour of the dock, from silver, to black).ë_ Laser etching of the logoë_on the front face completes the process (and allows for personalization should you desire, perhaps as a one off gift or as an innovativeë_corporate gift idea?ë_ Just drop me a line and we'll adapt our process to suit your needs). The custom plastic inserts are injection moulded.ë_ Silicone rubber feet are adhered to the underside of the dockë_to provide a high quality, non-slip base. To configure your  , the underside is removed by undoing the two M4 countersunk screws (a hex-head key is provided), the correct plastic insert is then placed into the dock from the top, the corresponding connector cable is then inserted and held firmly in place by tightening the hidden M4 hex screw in the back of the unit (although not shown on the video, all 3 screws will use the same hex-head supplied). The amount the connector protrudes can be adjusted depending on the cell phone case you have fitted (if any)..... .ë_ The base is then replaced and your   is ready to use.

"Endgame is inspired by the fusions of arcades and bars that have become popular in recent years. Unlike most bar entertainment, which is focused on sports, dancing, or pool halls, Endgame is focused on providing console based entertainment, creating an atmosphere designed to attract the gaming community.  We've chosen Phoenix as the destination for our first establishment because of its abysmal ratio of gaming venues to people. Endgame is about providing quality gaming experiences to all of its customers. To live up to that goal, we have a variety of game systems ranging from the NES to the PS4 stationed at every table (including the bar), an inventory stocked full of all of the newest games, as well as tons of the classics, and a staff composed entirely of game aficionados.  Console games can be requested from our library and played throughout the establishment. We began our stock of games by combining some personal collections, and have continued to expand since we started holding gaming events.ë_ To get an idea of the variety of games and systems we have available,  . Our library will continue to grow in the coming months before opening, and indefinitely after that, with popular new releases continually being added so our collection never gets stale. If there's a game we don't have yet that you would like to see, send us a request and we'll do our best to get our hands on a copy. In addition to our huge set of console games, we'll have several arcade cabinets set up with daily game rotations, and popular board/card games such as Cards Against Humanity and Munchkin. [See Update #2 for updated details on food] The 2000 sq ft restaurant space of our establishment will actually be sublet out to local food trucks, on a month-to-month basis. This allows us not only provide a variety of different food options to our customers while ensuring our menu never grows stale, but also to support the local food truck community by giving them the opportunity to service their food in a 9000 sq ft location at only a small fraction of the cost. We will always be providing the gamer staple of french fries and chicken strips, but for those looking for a healthier option or slightly more variety to their menu choices, we've got you covered!. Our ""Mana-restoration"" menu will feature established nerd drinks (like the Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster), as well as ones we'll be mixing up and testing ourselves (like the 1,000 Needles, with Midori and tequila). We would have roughly a dozen or so local beers on draft, along with a cider or two. We'll continue to adjust our selection based on demand. Other themed alcoholic items planned for our menu will include vodka PokÕ©balls, a full set of boss-themed drinks, and honestly anything else we can think to make an alcoholic-gamer pun out of. While our primary source of income is from alcohol sales, there is a $10 daily cover to access the gaming section. The cover provides all day access to the gaming area; once you've paid, you can come and go as much as you please throughout the day without ever paying a cent more. You'll never have to worry about carrying around tokens or quarters, since all our arcade cabinets are set to free-play and consoles don't accept quarters anyways. At the end of the day though, we are a bar. And as a bar, we want to encourage people to come hang out and socialize with their friends (and buy our beer) as much as possible! As such, there is no cover for the bar area, and drinking customers receive reductions on their gaming cover. We're aiming to open off of Mill Avenue in Tempe. This location is particularly convenient for ASU students, as it is immediately adjacent to the Engineering school's computer lab. For those travelling from off-campus, this location is conveniently located next to the light rail. There are also several parking garages and meters available that are free on nights and weekends. Although Endgame will be an alcohol serving bar, it is important to us to not neglect the vast majority of ASU students, who are primarily underage. To that end, we've set up a full 3000 sqft section of our space separate from the bar, that will be open to minors. Much later in the evening (sometime between 9 and 11 PM), however, the entire place will become 21+, which will allow beer and other forms of alcohol to be carried into all parts of the establishment.  Beyond our multitude of consoles, our full drink menu, and the fun social environment of a geek bar, we'll also be providing regular gaming events to celebrate gaming culture. We've partnered with AZHP Gaming to help host regular tournaments at our establishment; giving you the chance to battle it out with your peers for glory and gear! There are two rows of televisions above the main bar. The bottom row is connected to a set of consoles to be enjoyed by those sitting at the bar. The top row is dedicated to streaming, for the rest of the establishment to enjoy, anything from e-sports tournaments like League of Legends and Starcraft to speed runs of all your favorite games. We love celebrating all the major league gaming events, so you can be sure that there will always be something special planned anytime one occurs. As long as we can continue to get the space, we'll be holding monthly gaming events in our target location before we open. We call these ""beta tests,"" and they help us learn more about what is and isn't working, get more familiar with the space, and get an early start at building a community of gamers. ë_Our next one is June 14th, which is two days before our kickstarter closes, so feel free to come experience us for yourself before contributing! All of our reward tiers will give free access to the gaming area for the first time without cover. For all tiers above $1, your contribution can be used as credit for our gaming cover-charge for yourself or your friends. Our highest reward tiers nullify cover for you for life, with the highest tiers even allowing you to bring in friends to game with for free!ë_ For those who aren't local, we have a few options: our $25 - $150 rewards all come with Endgame swag such as shot glasses and shirts, and the $75 and $150 reward allows you to leave your mark by branding our controllers and consoles with your name/motto/favorite slogan/etc. Shipping is included for all domestic orders. $6 for all international. See the reward descriptions on the right for details on more specific tier rewards. We're a set of three nerds with a passion for gaming and a lot of enthusiasm about this project! All of us have experienced gaming bars and how fun they can be, and we really want to bring that joy to the community here. Ryan is an avid gamer, former ASU student, and the originator of this project. He's spent the last two years studying gaming bars in different parts of the country, learning from their mistakes and successes, and ironing out the details for Endgame. He was also responsible for recruiting the rest of the team we have today! As the head of Endgame, Ryan is in charge of recruitment, structuring and organization of the company. He's the guy that makes sure everything that needs to get done, gets done. Nikki's been a fan of console gaming since as early as she can remember, and provides much of our classic Nintendo library.

For instance there may appear a hole in the ice arena where the puck can easily fall or it can be fan,which will blow the puck away from its trajectory.

As for the rest of the gallery, I hope to create an atmosphere that allows the audience to absorb the aesthetic of Steampunk and have a complete experience with the art. At the opening reception, the first step to their occurrence will be the window display, putting on a live installation with Steampunk personalities bringing to life the essence of that world. And as they find their way into the gallery, the viewers will find that the art is not all that we offer, with seating arrangements made to look like the inside of a Victorian home and a silhouette video will be projected to tease them with more to come, which will remain on display for the remainder of the month. And as for libations at the reception, a master of his craft, Christian Marcus, will introduce everyone to his magical recipe of absinthe, along with his elaborate setups, that fits the theme of course. And not to forget the ragtime ambiance styling of Scott Joplin will fill the air and bring to life past generations.

The intention is for it to be a monthly show from 8pm-12pm and produced into 3 episodes which will be released weekly after the event... 6 Artists of various styles and discipline will go head to head in short art battles over 3 rounds with 2 artist going out per round, voted for by the crowd at the event! Each round will last 30 minutes apart from the finals which will take 1 hour, we're looking to make this a monthly event if all goes well and the final battle will take place on an interesting or unusual object such as an acoustic guitar or a skateboard! This will take place on the venue floor where the crowd can walk around the artists and take in how much work is actually required to create such amazing work! While the artists are painting there will be performances by Artists, Poets and Comedians on stage, the crowd can walk between the artists and/or listen to performers on the stage! creating an optionally engaging event! The evening will be filmed by 5 camera operators to ensure consistently great shots available for the show (in HD, hopefully moving to 4k in future), each round will be abridged into an episode and released once a week with regular clips/artwork being released as promotional material leading up to the next episode. The artists, and the artists favourite works will be showcased on the website for all to see, alongside exclusive interviews and 'artists in the wild' our low budget film covering the creative processes of the semi-finalists. The art and the music are self-explanatory, but one of the main things we hope to get out of these projects is a better understanding of Art, the creative process required and how much blood, sweat, tears and concentration it takes to create even the simplest piece!ë_ We want people to think deeply and be inspired by the beauty of the many forms which art comes in, as well as develop a respect for the creative process and the value of the hard work that goes into it (hopefully offering more then ë£100 for that 36 hour piece you just did). 2011, We co-founded the production group ""The RedWays"", We filmed many ""RedWay Sessions"" (which can be found on Youtube) for free, giving unsigned artists a high quality platform to showcase themselves, we have been doing this for 3 years covering local festivals and venues, one of which we had a monthly slot 3 months in a row leading up to Christmas 2012.ë_ 2013, We tried to produce a show called Free Art Movement U.K. but were unable to maintain it as it was significantly more expensive than our usual free sessions so we went back to the drawing board... 2014, After months of research we came up with the concept of combining 3 things we loved, Music, Live Entertainment and Art! Wasting no time we came together to create a proposal for a local venue, persuading them to let us put the show on. The venue said that if we raised enough money to produce the whole show ourselves, they would give us a discount rate and a monthly slot if it was successful!  So we've pooled together ë£1,500 from a combination of our own money and money invested by friends and family which should cover most of the venue, equipment, production and post-production but we still need about ë£1,000 to cover the travel cost of the contributors, insurances, other equipment, post-production(colouring/grading), online hosting and whatever may come up. ë_ We're hoping to have a total of ë£2,500 by the end of this campaign (combining the campaign funding with the funds I have raised externally), this breaks down to (Approximately) :ë_ ((Breakdown being adjusted)) if you have any questions/advice about the breakdown please get in touch with me/us :) Honestly, the biggest way to help, maybe even more then the lower grades of pledging, is by sharing us via social media sources, watching our videos and giving us feedback on how you felt about it.

Inspired by how much the community has utilized and contributed to the site, we are ready to take Acropedia to the next level! We would like for Acropedia to help build community by increasing the ways in which we can all share our acrobatic knowledge. The new Acropedia will include sections devoted to transitions, whips, pops, and standing acrobatics. The website will have a social function where everyone can create a user login to share their pictures, videos, and a map of events. In addition,   will become home to an online acrobatic learning library. Members can access video tutorials of acrobatic flows and moves. The social network functions, encyclopedia, and map will all be free for users. The membership part of the site will be online classes taught by world class acro teachers. The goal of $20,000 we_Ñéve set will help us hire programmers, data entry assistants, photographers, and video editors. We would love if you could contribute to helping   become the definitive online guide to partner acrobatics. To show our appreciation, we_Ñéve put together some rewards we think you will really enjoy! With your help, this dream can become a reality!

"We all have our ""Hardly Can"" projects. They could relate to: Career, Hobby, Relationships, Parenting, Education, etc. Hardly Can projects are those objectives that we'd like to achieve, ideas we romance - but for various reasons - hardly can. Hardly Can is also the name of a fictional, yet real, character in a poem that I wrote as part of my personal, ""hardly could"", ""romance project."" I mailed the first part of the 66 page poem anonymously, signed with an X, as if from a secret admirer. The poem worked spectacularly well as an ice breaker that lead to a friendship. In timeë_I wrote several other similar poems - though not as long as ""The Hardly Can Romance"". In the book, The Hardly Can Romance, I share each such poem and explain the details of how it came to be and the response of the girl. I also included some of my better works, including - ""The Teachers are All Commies"", ""Hummingbird"", and "" "". I also tell of the controversy and fallout from the senior predictions I composed for my high school graduation. Although the book is a fun and sometimes, ""humorous in hindsight"" read, Hardly Can embodies the way we all feel at times.ë_In the last chapter of the book I lament that Hardly Can is not at all limited to romance, but seems, rather, to be my life theme. Even so, it ends on a positive note to the reader - concluding in verse: At a higher level, The Hardly Can Romance is a hardly can project - nested two levels deep in other, larger, hardly can projects.ë_ My high level goal is to launch an education project called,  .  .ë_ So to help me launch the school I am creating a semi-autonomous robot music group to generate publicity and help me inspire students.  . So I created   to develop the tools and technologies for the music group. It started out slowly, but Hardly (that would be me)   and  . The Hardly Can Romance is one of the Launch Team 58 sub projects. I am hoping that by publishing The Hardly Can Romance I will be able to generate publicity for my music project, as well as help and inspire others with their own hardly can projects. (I'm serious when I say ""help"" - see the rewards). In promoting a project, eBooks and websites are powerful tools, but sometimes you have greater impact when you hand someone a tangible example or token of what the project is about. This is why I am pushing to publish hardback copies of The Hardly Can Romance. As you probably know, the per book printing cost is prohibitively high for small quantity orders. In larger quantities, the per book cost can drop dramatically, but then the total cost of the order becomes prohibitive. Either way, hard copies are beyond my reach as a self publisher. The funding from this campaign will allow me to place a large enough order to make the per book price reasonable. Even if you prefer to stay digital and don't want a new trophy for your shelf, I hope that you will consider backing this project.ë_In addition to the eBook, hard copy, T-Shirts and Cap, I am offering cast aluminum plaques that I cast in my own furnace, and access to an engineer via Skype to help pilot you through trouble spots with your own Hardly Can projects. Thank you for taking the time to consider my project! One of my better works was  The Hardly Can Romance has a website hosted at  . Your name will appear on the dedicated backer page. I can't sign eBooks, but I'd like to still be able to personalize a reward for those who want to help forward the project, but don't want a hard copy of the book. Available in pdf or epub formats 8.5"" x 5.5"" hard bound - approx. 155 pages. I am adding a few ""project pages"" to the back of the hardback version should you care to use them to plan the completion of your own hardly can project. I hope that in reading you will feel inspired to redouble your efforts, push forward and succeed. The shirt references humor from the book: I'll melt an ingot in my furnace and make you a sand cast plaque from the same   that I use for my shop tools and robot projects. I will sign and serialize (with an engraver)ë_each plaque (approx. 4.5"" x 6""). The pattern will be raised relief on the surface of the plaque (not a decal or silk screened). The plaque will be an unpolished sand casting - somewhat unique! Your name or company name will also be posted on a dedicated sponsors page at the   along with an image (picture of you, company logo, etc.).ë_ (All text/images must be small child appropriate - in my judgement - or I will request replacements) Have you ever needed periodic nudging to help you progress on your Hardly Can project? Did you ever wish you had access to someone who was technical to pilot you through technical aspects of your project? Just knowing someone is going to check up on you and your project progress each month can be a powerful motivator to do what you think you hardly can. I am also an experienced engineer and happy to share what I can to help you with the technical issues of your project. See my Kickstarter bio and   for examples of the types of experience that I have that might be helpful to you. This reward is not intended for projects that are pushing technological frontiers. I won't be signing non-disclosures or non-compete agreements. If what you want to talk about is patent-able, a company/trade secret, or you are concerned about someone stealing your idea - then this reward is not for you. However, if you know nothing about electronics or machine shop, CNC/CAM software, foundry work, etc. - and you want some guidance (I won't engineer it for you) then I might be able to save you weeks of time in trying to learn what you don't know from the internet.

"Hi! Check out the sections below! It's a lot to read so make sure you only check out what you need to, to decide you like the project! The first thing that people think of when I tell them I rap, (If it isn't 'Really?') is usually ""I'm not really into all of that violence and degradation. People jump to a conclusion that rap is an entirely misogynistic culture, that puts money and material goods above the human life. And aren't they right? I think it's time for a change. I want kids who are absorbing hip-hop lyrics at a crazy speed, to be taught that violence isn't impressive, and you can be influential without brandishing a weapon. I want a passage for adults and people who avoid the genre, that will flow them in, just as smooth as the words and rhythm are. I want the older generation to stop worrying about their kids obsessing over a celebrity, and actually judge their music based on quality. In short, I want hip-hop to be about the words. To deliver a positive message. And to stop looking so much at the self, and take a look outwards. I will admit, even up to my last project (a self funded EP) I found myself buying into the culture and propagating it. While proud of the technical skill and effort and time, I found myself wondering if I lost the ideals that I had started rapping with. You can find a link to it   but be warned it is  . I took some time after releasing this to just think. I did some collab work, but no projects of my own because I couldn't shake the feeling that I was headed in the wrong direction. And when I was browsing through my old videos it hit me. ë_This was what I was about.  My grandfather (who is spoken about in the second verse) was my hero, and to this day still is. But what I learned from him didn't translate in the aggressive showoff lyrics of my EP. Sure it was fun, but what did it really say? That's when the idea came to me. Iknew what my first full album would be, and it was something that had to be done. I needed to stop worrying about the I, or the them, or he/she/herhimyou and just focus on the us. The world had stories, and I was so selfish, to think the world only wanted to hear mine. I started rap ironically, I actually hated the idea. I had that same concept in my head, that the mainstream media produces, of guns, money, cars, and degrading women. But when I really got into the thick of it, it's about the words. And for me, that meant I could tell stories. Well it's time to tell the stories, because if there can be No More Goodbyes, then that leaves  At this point in my career, I'm happy enough to say that I've developed an entire self studio. It's barely that, but I have the mic, audio interface, the programs, and some MIDI controllers. Technically I can make this entire album myself. I've been working on creating some tracks on my own, some samples of instrumentals I've been able to produce are  .  I've also been mixing my own vocals for as long as I've been rapping (almost 2 years!) and there has been some considerable improvements! Check out an example  . (Entirely self produced) as well as   for a more story like example. I'm capable of making the music. But... I don't actually have the technology to create a professional sound. I might be able to come real close sometimes, but close isn't going to cut it. My goal is to spread this music, spread the stories, and spread the idea that hip-hop can be about the words, not just the public generated image. I want to get rights to record, sell, and perform with tracks that have been made by professionals. People who create beats for a living, people who can hear the music, the way I hear the words. I'd also love to be able to book some studio time. Walk in, and spit a mean line, and walk out with the professional sound. I don't want almost. I want spot on. There's more than an album at stake here. The overall goal is to spread awareness as well. To pass on this idea, of story telling in popular music. But to really spread the idea we need to make it popular first! I see this going as far as touring, and introducing other musical acts and performances, to really spread the story. And everyone has a story. You can learn something from any person who takes the mic, if they are willing to share. You can learn from a chord, or from the way the drums rush. And I want to spread the idea of sharing these stories through hip-hop, music, and popular expression. I'm looking to create a positive message. While it's great to throw in a clever line here and there, I want people to walk away from their speakers, thinking. I want those thoughts to create growth. And I want those thoughts to lead that person to create! I also want people to be inspired. It can't just be something you jam out to. While it's necessary sometimes (believe me I know!) to just jam, I want people to hear and want to create something better, and brighter, and bigger! To take the dream and move forward! The overall message is about caring, and truly understanding the places that someone may be in life. Empathy, compassion, and love. Because after all, this entire project was based on   This is the how's of it all. If you're looking for what is going to happen once the project funds, this is it. we surpass our funding goal, then we will talk about what crazy shenanigans we can get up to (i.e. touring, live recordings, etc.) This is the plan! I hope that you join as a member of this crazy ride! Any questions, let me know, I can't wait to get started!""",0,6.907755279,0,Hip-Hop,2013

"MOSS is a brand new robot construction system from  . It was designed, prototyped and engineered over the last two and a half years. Building with MOSS is incredibly fun and easy thanks to an intuitive, magnetic construction system.ë_ With MOSS there is no need for coding or wiring your construction. The power and data are sent through an elegant single button contact, while the ground passes through the steel spheres. MOSS uses over-molded neodymium, ""rare earth,"" magnets and carbon steel ball bearings to build a wide variety of constructions. The tactile click of building with MOSS is enough to keep you entertained for hours. It's easy to snap MOSS modules together to make a static structure, but to make things move and light up, you'll need to understand the color coding system for the individual faces.  Keep in mind that production MOSS kits will be different colors from the versions shown here.  We'll use these versions for this example, though, since we're surrounded by the pretty colors.ë_ Yellow faces conduct power.  If you look at the BATTERY module, you'll see that it has only yellow faces; this module's main purpose is to supply power to other modules.  To power up a MOSS module like a SPIN, for instance, you'll need to connect one of its yellow faces directly or indirectly to one of the yellow faces on a BATTERY module.  Blue and green faces conduct data: blue is data output and green is input.  If you want a DISTANCE sensor to control the speed of a SPIN, for instance, you'll need to connect the DISTANCE's blue data out to the SPIN's green data input.  Get it?  There's only one more face, the pink passthrough face, which can pass any signal, either power or data.  If your BATTERY is a few modules away from something you need to power, use the pink faces on a FLEXIBLE module (or a few single cubes in series) to transfer the power. Our first stretch goal has been unlocked!  We've hit $304k, so we'll ship all T-shirts out in December instead of waiting to ship them with your MOSS kits on February 2014.  USA backers, we're aiming to send your shirts just in time for Christmas! Our goal is to get them to you in time to have them wrapped and under the tree. International backers, we will be sending your shirts out in December, but given the wide geographic spread of backers we can't guarantee pre-Christmas delivery of your shirt. Thank you for your continued support of Modular Robotics and MOSS! We're pleasantly surprised about all of the inquiries we've received about programming MOSS. ë_Clearly, you want the ability to program your MOSS robots however you like! ë_If we hit $564,000, we'll be able to fast-track the development of two tools for MOSS programming: ë_ , which will let you write low-level C programs and flash them via Bluetooth into your MOSS modules, and  , an integration with  , the popular and easy-to-use block programming system. ë_Eric wrote   with some more details on these new plans. Work on MOSS began in 2010 as a   funded by grants from the National Science Foundation and the ASEE. Since then, we've been working to turn MOSS from a concept to a production ready robotics kit. MOSS started with sketches, ideas, and thousands of prototypes. The original concept used 3D printed frames, laser cut faces, copper connections and hand strung wire. Over thousands and thousands of hours in development, the various product concepts became the prototypes you see now.ë_ Over that time, while we were producing and selling  , we learned all about injection molding, over-molding magnets, metal stamping, and the other mass-production manufacturing processes needed to make MOSS on a commercial scale. One big challenge was getting enough magnetic holding force between blocks so people could build large constructions. We solved this with custom rare-earth magnets that have a concave face for maximum contact with the steel spheres. The plastic shells for MOSS were designed to snap together with appropriate draft angles for injection molding. The magnets were over-molded into the plastic shells in order to eliminate any chance of them coming out. Now that we've got the designs dialed, we're excited to share our work with you. The prototypes you see in the video represent ""T2"" plastics construction. We are tweaking the last few details before we order production ready plastics from our suppliers. Other parts like the microcontrollers and circuit boards are already on order. We expect Modular Robotics will receive final MOSS production ready components in mid-December 2013.ë_Our supply chain manager has toured our plastics and battery suppliers and verified that everything is proceeding according to plan. Production and assembly are scheduled to start near the holidays, continuing through January and beyond! All MOSS modules will be hand assembled in our robot factory in Boulder, CO. ë_It's uncommon to build toys or consumer electronics in the USA, let alone in Boulder.ë_ But fundamentally, we believe that by making our robots ourselves is the right thing to do. ë_It's fun, too, especially since we get to build robots to help us build robots.ë_ .  Just like our previous product, Cubelets, we're building everything ourselves so that we can ensure high quality and adapt quickly to changing conditions. Every assembly step of every MOSS module will be tested as it progresses through our factory Orders for each kit type will be fulfilled on a first come, first served basis. So the sooner you support our campaign, the sooner you can start playing with MOSS! We are going to start shipping kits as soon as we have modules, packaging and instruction booklets ready. .ë_The robots shown here are all prototypes.  Production MOSS will have better tolerance, fit, and finish.  But we haven't chosen the colors yet!  We may pick a color scheme that you hate, which is a risk.  Currently we really like this one, but it's not final.ë_""",0,11.51292546,1,Robots,2013

"  Utah Drone Imaging has seen a need that we can provide to the general public with our knowledge of UAV Imaging and feel we can help in the efforts of saving lives and locating people. We feel that this service should not depend on a person_Ñés ability to pay for this service when a life is at stake. That is why we are seeking the assistance of a Kickstarter campaign to obtain the necessary funds to build the UAV needed. This UAV that will be used on a volunteer or donation basis only in search & rescue operations. We are a new UAV Aerial Photography and Video Company based in Salt Lake City, Utah. We have our FAA Section 333 Exemptions and our pilot has been FAA licensed for 13 years with hundreds of hours in flight time. Our goal is to build a Search and Rescue Multi-Rotor UAV (drone) that can carry a forward looking infrared camera and other lifesaving supplies to injured or missing persons and assist in basic first aid needs. Our hope is that we can donate our time to search and rescue efforts and help save lives. Here in Utah we consistently have a need for such a drone! We recently had flash floods where several people were killed and some are still missing. We could fly that area in minutes where it would take search and rescue personnel hours and a helicopter may not even see them where a low flying UAV and an inferred camera would pick them out much easier. A few weeks back we had a 10 year old boy whom became lost hiking thank god he was found the next evening safe. We believe we would have been able to find him that night using this type of equipment. The most expensive part is the camera. Thermal Imaging Cameras can run thousands of dollars alone. We are a startup and we don_Ñét have the capitol to build this ourselves however there is an immediate need for this equipment. With winter coming, stranded and injured hikers and outdoor enthusiasts will increase that demand. Utah Drone Imaging_Ñés Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) will be able to provide real-time visual information and data in the aftermath of an earthquake, flood, hurricane, or other natural disasters and provide a first responder an eye in the sky to find a lost child or hiker. When a disaster or incident threatens lives and livelihoods, emergency responders require information and real-time imagery in order to make better decisions. UAS_Ñés can provide situational awareness over a large area quickly, reducing the time and the number of searchers required to locate and rescue an injured or lost person, greatly reducing the cost of search and rescue missions. They can be the first eyes in the sky _Ñ_ immediately after an incident, letting first responders know precisely where to direct resources. The possibilities for helping ensure public safety are endless. Our UAS will be designed to provide cost effective, real time data and imaging, day or night, in challenging conditions and without risk to personnel. Aiding in the search for missing persons is the infrared (IR) thermal imaging camera that can detect human body heat. This capability greatly increases the ability to find people or objects at night that may be hidden in brush or shadows, even during daytime operations. Our UAS offers the search and rescue industry capabilities that can reduce operational cost and risk, while improving efficiency. We will be able to deliver items such as First Aid Kits, AED's, Water and other essential lifesaving items to areas not immediately accessible to rescuers. Applications include:  - Currently we have spoken to several different companies that provide the parts we need. Building the UAV is not an issue however funding is. We have a listing of parts that come to approximately $9500 and could be built within 30 days. The most expensive on the list is the Infrared camera at around $3500 for the one we need.

"If you have ever used the smart phone app, Uber, then you have experience how revolutionary this concept has become. As a driver it has created opportunities for the unemployed and those that need extra income to make ends meet. As a rider it has created an awesome experience, where you are confident, safe, and pleased to be chauffeured with your interested in mind. This exchange between driver and rider has created a culture that has revolutionized the way we look at ride sharing and transportation.  There has been some controversy on this smart phone app, where several parties are doing their best to eliminate Uber from the consumers and volunteers that need them on a daily basis.  What I am doing is creating a photography book with captions and stories of the culture that has been created by Uber. I will be photographing drivers and riders (with their consent) and having them share stories, experiences, and thoughts to be added into the book. The point of this book is to show the importance of Uber and its positive effect on the economy. I plan on releasing several volumes of this book, visiting every major city that Uber is active and providing this wonderful service.  My first city will be Baltimore, where over a period of several months, I will capture the cultural an economic changes taking place in this city from the presence of Uber.  In my mission to publish this book, I want to show the masses that Uber is a positive presence and should not be feared by those that fight so hard to shut it down. I also want to introduce Uber to those that have never heard of the smart phone application and help them see the benefit of using it upfront, without having to try it out first.  If you are a driver, a rider, or just someone interested in my idea, I thank you in advance for checking it out and appreciate any support you can provide.  I look forward to making this project a success!!!!""",0,10.81977828,0,Photobooks,2014

"Weightless is a documentary that tells a story about a group of teenagers living with obesity who are brought together to embark on an amazing, and transformative journey through a specialized scuba diving program that was created by an organization called Diveheart.ë_ Jim Elliott, the founder and president of Diveheart, started the organization in 2001 to provide educational scuba diving and snorkeling programs to any child, adult, or veteran with a disability, with the hope of providing physical and psychological therapy. Looking to reach out to other communities that could benefit from zero gravity, Jim decided to extend his program to teenagers who struggle with obesity. This documentary will take an unbiased look at these teenagers and follow them as they overcome barriers, not only the challenges set forth by the Diveheart Foundation, but challenges in their daily lives as well. On the surface, the teens will be working with Jim and the Diveheart team on becoming certified scuba divers, but underneath they will be working on themselves emotionally.  As they begin to heal and build self-confidence a transformation will take place and the audience will watch these teenagers go from _ÑÒthe kid with the weight problem"" to _ÑÒthe kid that scuba dives."" Under the guidance of Jim and the Diveheart team, the teenagers will learn to scuba dive in a controlled swimming pool environment in preparation for an open water dive in the ocean that takes place at the end of the program. As the story progresses, the teens will learn to depend on each other as they work closely with the Diveheart team, working towards not only becoming certified scuba divers, but gaining the self confidence and independence that will help them face their own life challenges and overcome barriers that before might have seemed impossible. Weightless isn't the Undersea World of Jenny Craig. It's not a diet fad or a story about nutrition or access to the right diet. Weightless isn't even a solution. It's a start. Weightless means hope. It's a glimpse of the possible. Weightless is an invite to a level playing field. It just so happens that the field of play is underwater. The documentary will be shot traditionally, following each of the teenagers through out the day; home, school, training pool etc... and combining these scenes with interviews with our participants, their families, and members of the Diveheart Foundation.ë_ The use of underwater cinematography will also play an important role in this film. A high resolution camera, encased in a mobile underwater housing, will be used in the training pool as well as in the ocean. The use of high-resolution images will give the audience the experience of being right there with our cast, from their very first instructional dive to the final open water dive in the ocean.ë_ The film will conclude with a follow up with the cast 2-3 months after their open water dive to see how the Diveheart experience affected their lives. All money raised will be used for financing the entire film, from pre production to final distribution.    With the help of you and Kickstarter we can create a film that will reach out to young people all over the world who are struggling with obesity and identity issues and motivate them to imagine the possibilities in their own lives. This documentary has the potential to not only do well on the film festival circuit but also could find an audience with some kind of theatrical release as well as on cable television.

"A beautiful wall clock designed in the mid-century modern style. ë_The design uses genuine vintage  ë_to create a timepiece that is both striking and simple. ë_The center is carved from a solid block of hardwood cherry, engraved and painted with digits, and hand-finished to a soft shine. Just like any other analog clock or watch. ë_The fully lit tube is the ""long hand"" which shows the minutes, and the half lit tube is the ""short hand"" which shows the hours. ë_The Nixie Radian has a battery backup, so it will remember the time even if the power is interrupted.ë_ There are also a few different ticking animations (two of which can be seen in the video above). ë_Or, if you prefer, the clock can show only the hour and minute hands with no other movement. ë_Setting the time and display is done with two buttons on the back. The clock uses vintage IN-9 Nixie Tubes. ë_These are ""bargraph"" style, meaning the length of the glowing section is proportional to the current flowing through them. ë_All of the tubes used are New Old Stock, which is a fancy way of saying that they were made (far) in the past but have never been used before. ë_They should last in the Nixie Radian for many years. The hub of the Nixie Radian is made from 1"" thick select hardwood, milled in-house on a CNC router. ë_Then the numbers are engraved and hand painted. ë_The back is cut from 1/4"" MDF. ë_After all of the parts are completed, everything is hand-finished.   The circuit boards (which will be fabricated using  ) mount neatly inside, and everything is closed up and ready to go. All together, the clock is approximately 15"" in diameter. The clock hangs just like a picture. ë_It weighs less than 1lb and has a mounting hole to place it over a single nail. ë_The attached cord is 7' long and can hang straight down the wall. ë_That cord plugs into the end of the DC adapter cord, which is 5'+ on its own, so you can easily reach the nearest outlet. A successful Kickstarter campaign will give early adopters and trendsetters the chance to receive clocks at a much lower cost than the eventual retail price ($495). ë_Plus, you'll receive your clock before anyone else. ë_This is possible because the funding will enable Tungsten Customs to purchase components in bulk for future orders and new iterations. All of the reward levels starting at $345 get you one Nixie Radian with everything you need to get it up and running (a DC adapter, long enough power cord, instructions, etc.) ë_If you choose the FIRST BATCH level, you'll get yours before any of the other backers, expected in time for the 2015 holiday season. ë_ If you choose the CUSTOM ENGRAVING level, you'll be able to send an image that will be engraved on your clock. All clocks are made from hand-selected cherry, and available in either black or white (numbers & cord). ë_Unless we hit a stretch goal, in which case... : ë_New cord + number colors! ë_In addition to the original black and white, you'll be able to select from red, green, yellow, or gray.  ë_New wood types! ë_In addition to the original cherry, you can choose walnut or maple.

"We at CarLyd Fishing Products innovate proven fishing standards. In doing so, we are revolutionizing several aspects of the fishing products industry. The GenieJar is today's answer for the angler who loves to fish with live bait. Whether wading or walking the banks of their favorite river, stream or creek, or even when fishing their favorite pond or lake the GenieJar is a must have product. The GenieJar and its patent pending Dual-Lid/Floating Basket design allows the angler to quickly choose their bait without searching through icy cold water. Its design also allows the angler to completely submerse the jar to replenish old stale low-oxygenated water without the loss of a single bait fish.ë_ You get to fish the way nature intended, without any of the hassles we all faced before the invention of the GenieJar.  The GenieJar allows you to easily select and keep bait fish alive on your person. ë_-	No more carrying those large, bulky, and sometimes battery operated bait buckets with you when you are wading a river, stream, or creek. The same thing goes when walking the banks of a river, stream, creek, or body of water. ë_And what about if you are fishing from a kayak? ë_-	No more reaching into a large bucket of icy cold water to search for bait fish.  And no more need to empty out the water each time to easily retrieve a bait fish. ë_-	No more losing bait fish each time you need to replace old, low oxygenated water with fresh, highly oxygenated water. ë_If you_Ñére like me, you have faced these same problems when it comes to fishing with live bait fish.  Some of you might have even given up on fishing with bait fish because of these problems.   You do not have to suffer any longer.  Fishing with live bait is quickly becoming more popular than ever.  Get your GenieJar and start enjoying the art of fishing with natural bait again!ë_   In late March of 2015 we contacted a test market of 32 independently owned bait & tackle dealers in Pennsylvania to test our first product. Of those we contacted, 28 elected to sell the GenieJar, and they sold hundreds of units in under six weeks. We also have had great success with our online store.    The Cipher model of the GenieJar is our flagship product. It is the first of several products that we have in store for the fishing industry. The next offering in our GenieJar line, the Optimus model, is currently in prototype phase with an early 2016 New Product Release (NPR) date. We are currently manufacturing the Cipher GenieJar but demand is rapidly increasing. We are also getting requests on a daily basis from both retailers and consumers for the larger Optimus size.  ë_ë_The Cipher model of the GenieJar was recently featured in the PA Outdoor Journal. If funding permits, we will be listing it in the new product section of several global publications targeting the fishing enthusiast.   We need to produce 5000 of each model and begin filling orders by January 1, 2016.  In order to do this we will need to implement 3 key items:  1.	New Molds - new molds built to our specification will achieve a more robust and consistent molding process.  This equates to a higher quality and more consistent product.  This will also be key when we incorporate several strategically timed product iterations.   2.	Starting Inventory - we need capital to purchase raw material.  And fast! Purchasing raw materials at higher levels will ensure our ability to make a product that meets the consumer price point, and for us to be profitable. 3.	Advertising _Ñ_ We have to get the word out.  While we have already developed strong partnerships with our vendors and a select group of retailers, we need to expand our presence to retailers nationwide, regional and national distributors, and independent sales persons and agencies.     Since fishing is a year round family oriented activity, we need to ship product as we progress through this important phase of our business. We realize too that pricing is important, and the Kickstarter program affords us the financing we need quickly and at an affordable price. We need your financial support to make this dream a reality. Meeting our financial target will allow us to go back to all those retailers, distributors and others and inform them that it is full steam ahead for CarLyd Fishing Products.

Meanwhile, our other pirate, a beautiful woman with flair, overhears Greenbeard discussing his gold with his first mate, and decides to chase him down and steal his gold after he finds it.ë_ Each of our pirates admires the other, while their respective first mate's share a slightly more overt and romantic relationship.

"5 years ago, the world of art and mainly street and pop art, took me by storm! My eyes lit up at the bold colors rising out of dilapidated urban landscapes. My brain awoke with the statements being made. Unfortunately, I lived in a small town in Missouri for 4.5 of those years and there was not much to see there. I had to live vicariously through documentaries on Netflix and google image searches. 5 months ago I moved to Los Angeles to further pursue my musical goals and dreams. While music is an amazing outlet for my creativity, I felt compelled to express myself visually in other ways. I have had runs ins with attempts painting before. I was successful at painting guitars for awhile, but only solid colors or with stripes. When it comes to drawing or painting anything in an actual artistic sense, it isn't pretty. Since I cannot create, I figured, why not document it and share with all my friends from other states that are not here to see it for themselves. I only had my cell phone, but figured it was good enough, so I grabbed my skateboard and started skating down every street in LA searching out as much art as I could find and photograph. A funny thing happened and some of my friends that are photographers started telling me that I had an eye for photography and that I needed to get a professional camera. That's cool and all, but I'm a musician, so i'm broke all the time. If I am a musician and a photographer, will that mean that I am somehow even more broke? Sometimes I have to climb a pipe and a fire escape ladder to get a good shot, sometimes I have to get over a bit of razor wire. I do whatever I can to get the best shot I can with the tools I have. I am taking this mindset to Kickstarter in an attempt to do all I can with what I have to get an actual camera and begin my newest creative venture properly. The camera I am after is a Fujifilm x100t. A photographer that used to take pictures of my band had one. It took amazing shots, was small and discreet, and just had an overall look that inspired me to want to wield it. One of these new runs $1200-1300. Any extra money raised from this campaign will go towards bags/cases, lenses and traveling to other cities to document the amazing art across this country and maybe even the world.

Then we as parents pack their toiletries, clothes, shoes, pillows and other necessities. Before we knew it there was no room in the car for the kids«Å_ that_Ñés how BuddyBagz was created.

"I did my first interview on the couch of our tenement apartment when I was 10 years old. ë_I used to stay in the house because my asthma and DC summers weren't a good match. ë_I watched Mike Douglas, Dinah Shore and the legendary Merv Griffin talk to everybody about anything. ë_I thought it was so cool and I've been doing it my entire life. ë_I can talk to anyone about anything because I love talking to people. I would talk to my imagery guests, who were real people who just not yet been interviewed by me. ë_We'd exchange ideas and laughter and then I'd do my homework or chores around the house, generally because one of my brothers was now home and I didn't want to interrupt the flow...or invite them onto the show.ë_ Then, life added so much to the mix when I went to college, majored in and graduated with a triple major of Accounting, English and Spanish, worked as a Budget Analyst and then moved on to BET and built a career that has allowed me to sit down with the legends of Natalie Cole, Tina Turner, Stevie Wonder and Sade and to played a role in building the careers of superstars as Maxwell, Brandy and Aaliyah. ë_I developed new shows and life was great. I was initially a researcher and before I did that, I was and still am an avid reader. ë_When I would sit down to interview or engage celebrities, many marveled at the details in my questions and the information I was able to cite. ë_Singer Toni Braxton and I had a great rapport and she laughingly asked ""why don't ë_YOU have a TV show? ë_You are great!"" ë_I smiled and said ""thank you"" but thought it could never be so. ë_Even after it came up again and again and I was called to do TV appearances for various topics from co-hosting a music awards show to speaking on politics and religion, I couldn't envision how I could bring the idea of a talk show into fruition without a network, until now!ë_ Soon, in another turn, motivation and social justice work called me into ministry and I have done a great of community work that has allowed me to work with youth communities, entrepreneurs, activists and the likes. ë_But, my television experience came calling again and new programs were developed for the BET Networks, including Parallel Paths, Lifted and Chronicles From The Underground, which ran for 3 seasons.ë_ So I have spent several years as an entrepreneur with my own publishing company, after writing my first empowerment books and romance novels under TM3 Utterances, an arm of my own company TaylorMadeMusicMomentos now TaylorMadeMultiMedia (TM3). Thre have been more TV appearances, magazine and social media interviews, and a host of seminars and workshops were I have been able to interact with people from California to Connecticut, North Carolina to northern New York. ë_ I soon realized that with the expansion of social capital through friends and followers, and access to people without media mogul's approval, the time is now and I have to answer my own question: ë_NOW WHAT?! I am a writer, a producer, a minister, an empowerment coach and a motivational speaker. ë_People wonder HOW I have been able to do it all and that's what NOW WHAT?! is all about in a nutshell. ë_How do you live in your dreams, accomplish then, and then continue to believe that you can dream? ë_How do you get up from heartbreak or disappointment and keep on going? ë_How do you move forward? ë_How do you answer life's toughest yet most obvious question? ë_NOW WHAT?! NOW WHAT?! is a talk series, hosted by me, where I will interview people who have dared to dream AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT! ë_If it's people who've left corporate jobs to start their own businesses, people who have grown up in their industry and had to deal with aging or people who thought that the influx of money would change things...and it didn't for the good; these are the people I want to talk to on NOW WHAT?! From Natalie Cole to Cory Booker, from the mom who started a bakery in her kitchen and is now a millionaire to the kid who wanted to be a rapper because he never thought he could be a lawyer and now has his own practice. ë_NOW WHAT?! is about ACTION! I want to be able to do two shoots, one in the Newark/New York area, where I live and one in California, for this first round of shows, which should be about 13 episodes. ë_That way I am not just talking to the same mindset. ë_I want to hire crew guys that I have built great relationships over the years and sit down and talk. ë_I want to make great television and have great conversations, my way, with people I believe amazing stories, some of which never get told OR some of which haven't been produced well because corporations run to the same artists and actors to talk, thinking its easy ratings, when what I do is great television! I want to build  ë_a feature website where the show can be broadcasted and which can be a launchpad for other great programming.ë_ NOW WHAT?! WITH KEVIN E. TAYLOR will bring all of me to the same purpose as I talk to people from music, acting, politics, business and other fields about how they have taking on life's challenges and transitions and kept going. ë_Many people are stuck trying to answer AND THEN WHAT?, which is fear-based and keeps your stuck because you want all of the answers before you will move and the answers don't come UNTIL you move. ë_You can only ask NOW WHAT?! after something has already happen, after you've learned the lesson or at least experienced what has brought the lesson. ë_NOW WHAT?! WITH KEVIN E. TAYLOR is a show that has been a lifetime in the making and I hope that you can help me the dream project come to life. ë_""",0,9.105424202,1,Webseries,2013

"Welcome to the year 2861. Centuries of growing secularism have choked off the lifeblood of organized religion, forcing them to adapt or die. Most slipped away to extinction. The Catholic Church though, flush with assets, chose the first path. No longer able to usher mankind into a heaven it largely no longer believes in the Church now seeks to unlock the worlds outside of earth. Once a bastion of faith the Church is now the standard bearer for science, human genetic development, and ethics. Yet, as always, it struggles to find the balance between what is right and what is expedient, and how to combat the corrupting influences of near-absolute power. Faith, though, is not yet lost. Faced with an unprecedented crises - major habitation outside of earth - the conservative fringes of the world's major religions find themselves uneasy allies. The Abrahamic faiths - Islam, Judaism, Christianity, and their myriad of off-shoots - all look to the day when the last battle between good and evil rages on earth, and peace reigns supreme as their deity assumes the throne. Yet, how can this happen if mankind is no longer confined to the earth? Small in number, they view the direction of the Church and the colonies on the Moon and Mars as nothing short of heresy.ë_Some stand unyielding in their beliefs. Others resort to violence.  Hundreds of years prior, in 2492, scientists and engineers, entrepreneurs and pioneers, free thinkers all, established mankind's first colony on Mars. The economy flourished as the solar system began to give up her sizable resources. An economic powerhouse, the Free Thinkers have lived and died for generations in the hostile expanse of space. Living under the continuous threat of terrorism by the religious conservatives and the weight of Catholic expansionë_they are faced with a desperate gamble - a Black Cross or death. This is our concept. Throw in great characters, exquisite writing, and super-detailed (and physically realistic) ships and space combat, and we hope to deliver a ripping tale of adventure, love, loss, faith, the threat of freedom and search for truth. We want to explore the tension between religion and science, faith and free thinking, and where we are today versus where we are headed. Hi, I'm Brad White. I have been writing for quite awhile now (you can read my blog at   to get a taste) but I have never focused long enough to crank out a fiction novel. I've had the basic idea for this book for about a year but lacked the compelling story to make it really sing. That changed when my brother and I were talking about the future of religion. I quickly realized that this was the narrative to bring everything else together! Much of the inspiration for the characters and ships comes from current naval technology and tactics, especially submarine warfare. With nothing but a whole lot of, well, nothing between ships stealth and defense become critical. Great care is taken in regard to orbital mechanics, space flight, and the physics of projectile and beam weapons. Life aboard the ships is anything but pleasant. The future may be glamorous, but it's still gritty. You can veiw our progress on ship design here:ë_http://blackcrossbooks.com/ship-designs/ In addition to writing I have a masters degree in engineering (hence the meticulous approach to space ship design and combat physics) and paint when there is nothing better to occupy my time.

"BOOK TITLE: THE NON-PAREILS ( WITHOUT EQUAL) CHAPTERSë_ WITH SHORT SYNOPSIS OF EACH: 1. THE BEGINNINGë_- When your Father dies when you're eight years old and you goë_ toë_work setting up pins in a bowling alley from 6:00 p.m. to midnight for fiftyë_cents,ë_you learn discipline, perseverance and self-relianceë_very quickly. 2. THE FLIGHTLINEë_- You wouldn't expect your aircraft to be riddled with bullets while setting on the tarmac at an Air Force base in South Carolina, but there are many surprises on the flightline. 3. TRAINING -ë_ Eight months of grueling physical, mental and psycological activityë_that makes today's Special Operations training seem like aë_picnic. Run five miles in thirty-five minutes carrying eighty pounds of gear, weapons and ammo, no problem. 4. THAILAND - Ubon, home base of the International Oceanic Survey. In reality, a covert CIA operation photographing all of Southeast Asia and OTHER areas. 5. THE MIG - The bogey was a fast-mover closing on the RB66B at close to 600 knots. His radar locked onto us. I pressed the fire buttonë_for the twin 20mm cannons in the rear of the Destroyer. The mig flew right into the projectiles. 6. TURNABOUT - The look on the face of the North Vietnamese Army officer was one of bewilderment and terror, just a split second before the back of his head was blown out by his own pistol which was not now in his hand. 7. CAPTURE - As I ran down the trail, from the jungle on each side stepped at least a dozen NVA soldiers. They took me down, beating me unmercifully, torturing me for five hours. Then I got my chance. The fight didn't last ten seconds. Those three NVA died brutally. I was really mad.ë_ 8. BIG EARS - The NVA terror squad leader had enormous ears. He was a torturer, sadist, murderer, rapist and degenerate. I brought him back to the village he had terrorized two days earlier. The big ears still attached to his head. His head attached to nothing. 9. FATAL ENCOUNTER - The NVA sergeant jumped up from behind the elephant grass, his AK47 pointed at my face. I raised my Thompson 45. caliber sub-machine gun and squeezed off a short burst. Four holes stitched diagonally across his chest. I was quicker.ë_ 10. THE CRATER - War is hell. The crater was madness. Close to a hundred men pretty evenly divided between North and South Vietnamese and a few Caucasians in a pit about five feet deep and the size of half a football field intent on killing each other with any means available, rifles, knives, clubs, hands. I wondered why there was water squishing under my boots when the dirt was so dry it was like asphalt. Then I realized it wasn't water, it was blood. 11. THE WATERHOLE - Thirst can drive men mad. The deadly lack of hydration that causes the tongue to swell so much as to fill up the whole mouth and the upper lip to block the passage of air into the nostrils. To quinch that thirst, men fight and die for a sip of that relieving liquid mixed with bloodë_from a muddy puddle . 12. THE SNAKE - What to do? You're lying on your back in a shallow ditch in the dead of night covered with a thin coat of leaves and twigs with two NVA soldiers standing directly over you, oblivious to your presence. Then you fell the weight across your right shin, becoming heavier as it inches upward toward your groin,across your chest. You feel the delicate touch of a flickering, forked tongue on your cheek. Your heart is pounding. You're terrified. The mission is about to be comprised! What to do? ë_13. CAVES OF KHE SANH - The origins and ages of the old mines are obscure.They are now just caves and tunnels that serve the NVA and Viet Cong very well.The small diameter tubes that extend upward from the caves to the surface are dug at an angle that will bracket a pre-determined target once a mortar round is fired from inside the cave, reaping death and destruction on the unfortunate inhibitants of the targeted area. 14. TREE SLEPER -ë_ Too many snakes and critters on the jungle floor. Sleep on a tree limb with your pack as a pillow, secure yourself with your Sam Brown belt. Wait. There's a noise in the clearing below. NVA stacking coffins. An indication of a big battle coming. I'll be daybreak soon. If someone looks up. I'm a goner.Ah. I have an escape plan. Will it work? There must be over a hundred NVA below. 15. CLAYMORE IN THE CIRCLE - I've reconnoitered this area several times. A large clearing hidden by underbrush when not in use. Large meetings of the Viet Cong Cadre are held here. I'll be at the next one with some friends, the claymores.These fellows, small bombs containing hundreds of steel balls about the size of double ought buckshot, can sure ruin a VC party. I've got twelve buried around the clearing. I know when the VC are coming. I'm waiting. 16. The PHANTOM - The Spetsnaz, Russian covert ops troops, are here. One in particular operates in my area, assassinating village chiefs and other officials friendly to the South Vietnam Government. We've never had contact. I'm leery of him. He just might be as good as me. We'll soon know. Tonight I plan to end his career permanently. If only I could see him. 17. THE MOUNTAIN -ë_ The vast plain began to rumble as if a giant, mechanized caterpillar were moving across it. In the dead of night I could see nothing, even through the lens of my infra-red camera. Suddenly, the whole area was bathed in an eerie light and I beheld a sight that was both astounding and confusing. Then, darkness again, for forty-eight minutes. Light again, the subjects belowë_ disappearing in various modes ofë_conveyance. All of this on film. The second morning afterward I'm one of only two left aliveë_out of twenty-one after four frontal assaults by a crack NVA batallion. I can't survive the next assault. I place my film in the protective canisters and bury it, deep. I hear the bugle blow, the attack is coming!ë_ 18. AFTERMATH - After the ten days of convalescent leave I call ë_Air Force HQ in Denver. To which base do I report? None, Sergeant. You're out. Discharged. Honorable. Just an early out. I didn't want out. Nontheless. I was no longer needed. I knew too much. I, and those like me, were not to be in the Air Force population ever again. For forty-eight years I stiffled my memories, my disillusionment, my questions and made a life. 19. THE LAST MISSION - I'm going back to Vietnam. To the Mountain where the canister is buried. The co-ordinates are in my head. It's an expensive trip. A dangerous trip. Pirates on the Mekong and Red rivers. Bandits and smugglers. Unexploded ordinance. All seemingly good deterents. Not anymore. The film is truth. Questions asked and questions answered. The American nation needs to know the truth about the beginnings of that long and terrible and useless war. My last mission is now starting. I never failed in a mission. With your help, I will accomplish this last mission.""",0,10.54534144,0,Fiction,2012

"We are making a   for PASO, a hour long drama pilot I wrote featuring my hometown of Paso Robles, California as a main character.  The idea is to create interest in the script and get this thing on television. PASO is about intersecting lives at a winery located in the heart of California's Central Coast. The characters in the story come from varying backgrounds but all have one thing in common: They are seeking a second chance. The center of the story is Will Hearst who arrives back home after serving a prison term for manslaughter. Viticulture runs deep in his families history and Will has a gift for vino. He possesses that magic of knowing just when to pick a grape and how to cultivate it into a layered, distinguished bottle. Carnegie is the owner of the winery where Will wants a job. He's  already failed in Napa, but managed to create one of the decades great  wines in the process. He came to Paso with his young, beautiful daughter  Meghann to start over. Meghann is a young woman just discovering  herself and her sexuality. She approaches life with curiosity. Meghann  has also managed to entice both Will and his cousin / best friend Cal. Pia  is Will's opposite and his antagonist. She's a confident professional. A  little buttoned up, but has a wild side that she tries to keep hidden.  Alice  is a movie star whose career is on the skids and comes to Paso with  change on her mind. While waiting for her next big movie she decides to  invest in a winery and recruit Pia to act as her proxy.  There are few things you can do in life that can influence millions of people at any given time. Television can do that. You change their mood. You make them laugh. You make them cry. You make them root for your imagination and they reward you with loyalty. Entertainment changes people's lives. It gives them courage. It shows them understanding. It allows for hope.  These are lofty ideals but it doesn't make it any less true. I love television. I love film. I believe in it. When it's done right, it's a collaboration of hundreds of people working their hardest to make a single vision come true.  The goal of _ÑÒPaso_Ñù is to create the _ÑÒmagic_Ñù that is associated with great television and film. I want people to tune into a show that  transports them to another world and at the same time relates to their everyday struggles.  For those of us who have lived in Paso we know how special the region is. Great food. Great wine. Great passion.  If we can show people that passion on screen they'll fall in love with _ÑÒPaso_Ñù and it will become a part of their lives.""",0,6.907755279,0,Shorts,2013
"Predictive analytics is used to anticipate the future using historical data. Big companies leverage predictive analytics to improve efficiency. Imaging you work for a company that's on the hunt for a new source of oil.  A mature industry means there are hundreds of thousands of records about previous explorations. Some explorations are successful, and some are not. Each exploration leads to the generation of more data.   The information (data) includes things like the type of rocks, soil type, and type of terrain. When you crunch the numbers you can find similarities that increase the probability of finding oil. For this example, let's assume the probability of finding oil at a new site is 40%. The 40% chance is the output from our application.ë_ In this case, the Insight will influence the company's decision to invest in drilling or not. If the company doesn't have any data, they start recording it because it will help in the future. ë_ Is it possible to make better decisions based on Insights from your personal data? Yes! How can Life's Insight improve your quality of life? By helping you analyze your data without needing to be an expert in analytics.ë_ We use the same analytics that big companies use but we use them to help predict your future.ë_ You don't have to learn any math or do any calculations to understand how to search for oil. All you do is collect data with our simple interface and let our software do the rest.  An Insight is the chance of something happening based on a unique data set / information. Each Insight created will be focused on addressing your individual needs. The question we have is, what's important to you?  ë_How likely and when should I plan for any additional medical expenses? There is a 70% chance in January that you will have an unplanned medical expense. When should I have extra money in my budget for an unexpected car repair? There is an 80% chance you will have an unplanned car repair in the next 3 months.  These are the typical events that alter budgets and cause stress. If you_Ñére wondering if you can really afford that quick getaway weekend, we can help! Where is a great place to catch a Pikachuë_tonight? There is a 60% chance Pikachuë_will be in Roosevelt park between 8-10 PM. What's the chance of beating Tim at fantasy footballë_this week? There is a 63% chance you will win with your current roster.ë_ Take your fantasy teams to the next level and play like a pro! I can't think of what I want for dinner tonight?  There is a 75% chance you would like Chinese.  What the chance I'll go for a run later? 0%, you never run past 5 pm on Fridays. There is an 80% chance you'll have a beer! The application uses the data you provide to calculate the chance of events occurring.  We call each of these systems:  .   Our goal is to provide hundreds of Insights into your life. Our hope is each Insight will lead to more positive experiences and a better life! You choose when and how you want to participate in an Insight. Each Insight has specific data associated with it, and in most cases, is directly provided by you using your smartphone. The data is processed and feedback is provided. You can get feedback based on a messaging callback system for scheduled alerts or even in real-time by directly using the application interface. The Insights we provide can truly be invented by you or by us. To create an Insight, you don't need to learn anything about analytics you just need to track what's important to you. You can choose to share your Insight with friends, the public or keep it to yourself. It's up to you.   We believe that these systems will influence your decisions. Because of this, there will be an interface to ask ""what-if"" type questions.ë_ To create a collection of Insight systems for our users that are focused on your needs and add value to your life.ë_ Since the idea around Pokemon Go was the beginning of our story, we included the case study on our funding page. We have a lot of other Insights already in the works, so check out our website.ë_ Consider the Pokemon Go user. One of the biggest challenges is knowing where and when to catch the specific Pokemon. All you need is to track is the type of Pokemon, did you capture it, what time and where did you catch it.ë_ You now have a personal tool to track and predict Pokemon locations/times.   Q: Will I encounter a Charizardë_in the park on Sunday afternoon?   A: 12% chance based on available data   The accuracy of Life's Insight is directly linked to how much data is available. Let's assume Pokemon Go players are people who love to share and they opt into joining the public Insight. This provides tons more data to be considered and analyzed.  Q: Will I encounter a Charizardë_in the park on Sunday afternoon?   A: 38% chance based on available data   Q: So where is the best location to catch Charizard near me on Sunday?   A: There is a 74% chance a Charizardë_will be at the Mall between 4-6 PM. If your only objective to go somewhere and catch a Charizardë_it looks like your odds are way better at the Mall. Life's Insight uses predictive analytics to process the data you provide within a given Insight. ë_The only thing you need to do is start collecting data. ë_We'll help with what data will be the most insightful by making suggestions on what to track for a given Insight. We let you choose how you want to participate in each Insight (Public / Private). We keep everyone's participation with public Insights completely anonymous.  You could group with other Pokemon players in the area and share predictions. Share data, talk about what data makes the best Insights and grow together by learning more about yourself in the process. With the right data we can predict just about anything Anyone and everyone, from individuals to big businesses.ë_ For those that want to build or do research we have created the Group Insight sandbox which lets teams of people work together. Students and researchers will find this can replaces the need for using surveys. Doing another study for your Psych program? Now you can directly publish your study as an Insight and let users fill it out. We also have an interface for people who want to participate and support research. We connect you directly with researchers and students who are making an impact on science today, and when they need you to help, you can be there for them.  Communities of people like a Wine club or Book club can use Group Insights to aggregate data and see what the predictions are. Group predictions are based on the perspective of the entire group of participants. We will allow importing of data so you can use Life's Insight as a predictive analytics platform for the data you already have. Use your sales data to predict staffing requirements and adjust inventory levels. Use your data to predict if a new product will be well received by your customers.ë_ Analysis your incoming leads and optimize your sales efforts by focusing on leads with the highestë_probabilityë_to close.
