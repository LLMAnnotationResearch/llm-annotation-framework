Task: Generate [number] unique prompts for evaluating [clearly defined task, e.g., whether texts satisfy specific criteria or conditions].

Use these prompting strategies evenly:

zero_shot: Direct evaluation with no additional context

few_shot: Include 2-3 clear examples with classifications and reasons

cot: Chain-of-thought with explicit analytical steps

role_based: Evaluation from specific expert perspective

self_consistency: Multiple passes with majority voting

tot: Tree of thought with multiple analysis paths

rot: Reasoning with competing arguments

Requirements for ALL prompts:

Must explicitly state the evaluation task clearly: "Evaluate whether [clearly state the evaluation criteria for classification]."

Must end with: "Answer only with a number (0 or 1). Here is the text:"

Must output strictly binary classification (0/1).

Must maintain consistent structure within each strategy.

Must be unique and not repeat previously generated prompts.

Strategy-specific guidelines:

ZERO_SHOT:

Direct question.

No additional context.

Example: "Please read the following text and evaluate whether [explicit evaluation criteria]. Answer only with a number (0 or 1). Here is the text:"

FEW_SHOT:

Include exactly 3 examples.

Each example must clearly state: [description/example], classification (0/1), and explicit reason.

Follow format: "'[EXAMPLE]' = [0/1] ([REASON])"

Example: "Evaluate whether [explicit evaluation criteria]. Examples: 1) '[Example 1]' = 1 ([Reason]), 2) '[Example 2]' = 0 ([Reason]), 3) '[Example 3]' = 1 ([Reason]). Using these examples, classify the following text. Answer only with a number (0 or 1). Here is the text:"

COT (CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT):

List 4-5 explicit analytical steps.

Steps progress logically toward classification.

Number steps explicitly.

Example: "Evaluate whether [explicit evaluation criteria] by following these steps: 1) Identify main [element/aspect], 2) Determine [criteria step 2], 3) Analyze [criteria step 3], 4) Assess [criteria step 4], and 5) Conclude with classification (1=yes, 0=no). Answer only with a number (0 or 1). Here is the text:"

ROLE_BASED:

Begin with "As a [EXPERT ROLE],"

Clearly specify relevant expertise.

Link expertise directly to evaluation task.

Example: "As a [expert role relevant to task], evaluate whether [explicit evaluation criteria]. Based on your professional expertise, classify with 1 (yes) or 0 (no). Answer only with a number (0 or 1). Here is the text:"

SELF_CONSISTENCY:

Clearly specify exactly 3 evaluation passes.

Each pass with distinct analytical focus.

Mention explicitly a majority-based final classification.

Example: "Evaluate whether [explicit evaluation criteria] three times: first considering [aspect 1], second [aspect 2], and third [aspect 3]. Provide classification (1 or 0) for each pass, then conclude with the majority decision. Answer only with a number (0 or 1). Here is the text:"

TOT (TREE OF THOUGHT):

Start with clear task statement.

Specify exactly 3 distinct analytical paths.

Each path with clear analytical focus.

Mention the requirement to synthesize results.

Example: "Evaluate whether [explicit evaluation criteria] by analyzing through three distinct paths: 1) [Path 1], 2) [Path 2], and 3) [Path 3]. Synthesize the insights to conclude with final classification (1=yes, 0=no). Answer only with a number (0 or 1). Here is the text:"

ROT (REASONING WITH COMPETING ARGUMENTS):

Start with clear task statement.

Provide bidirectional analysis (pro/con).

Require explicit evaluation of argument strength.

Include confidence rating explicitly.

Example: "Evaluate whether [explicit evaluation criteria] by exploring competing arguments: for classification as 1 (yes), list two supporting reasons; for classification as 0 (no), list two supporting reasons. Assess argument strength and confidence (high/medium/low). Provide a final classification based on the strongest reasoning chain. Answer only with a number (0 or 1). Here is the text:"
